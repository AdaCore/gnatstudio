   Version : Ada.Strings.Unbounded.Unbounded_String :=
     Ada.Strings.Unbounded.To_Unbounded_String ("@GPS_VERSION@");
   --  Version number of this software

   Target  : constant String := "@TARGET@";

   Prefix : constant String := "@prefix@";

   --  Note that this prefix can be overridden by using the GPS_ROOT or
   --  GNAT_ROOT environment variables.

   Host : constant Host_Type := @HOST_TYPE@;
   --  Host kind where GPS is built.
   --  Note: it is in most cases inappropriate to test the value of this
   --  variable and do different things based on it. Consider using this
   --  variable as a last resort, to address very target specific issues.

   Source_Date : constant String := "@GPS_DATE@";

   Max_Frame : constant := 500;
   --  Maximum number of frames displayed in the backtrace window

   Max_Tasks : constant := 999;

   --  True on systems where lines are separated by both LF and CR

   Async_Commands : constant Boolean := True;
   --  True if user commands are handled asynchronousely, to avoid recursion
   --  in the event processing. See design/commands.txt for more details.
   --  This variable is primarily useful for debugging.

   Can_Output : constant Boolean := @CAN_OUTPUT@;
   --  True if gvd can print text on standard output/error, false if gvd

   --  Command used to run helpers

   Default_Ps : constant String :=
     "@DEFAULT_PS@";
   --  Command used to list processes on a native system. The String is on
   --  its own line to avoid exceeding line length.

   Default_Print_Cmd : constant String := "@PRINT_CMD@";
   --  Command used to print a file

   Default_Opaque_MDI : constant Boolean := @OPAQUE_MDI@;
   --  Default value for the MDI opaque preference

   Default_Diff_Cmd : constant String := "@DIFF_CMD@";

   --  Default charset for the host, used throughout GPS to convert strings
   --  from outside GPS (e.g. pathnames, compiler output, file contents, ...)
   --  to UTF-8 internally.
