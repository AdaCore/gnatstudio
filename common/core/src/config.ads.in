package Config is

   type Host_Type is (Windows, Unix, VMS, Unknown);
   --  Possible kind of host where GPS is built

   ---------------
   -- Constants --
   ---------------

   Current_Year : constant String := "@CURRENT_YEAR@";
   --  The year to display in copyright notices

   Version : constant String := "@GPS_VERSION@";
   --  Version number of this software

   Target  : constant String := "@TARGET@";
   --  Target for which GPS is built

   Darwin_Target : constant Boolean := @TARGET_IS_DARWIN@;
   --  running on OSX ?

   Prefix : constant String := "@prefix@";
   --  Default prefix used e.g for finding support files like po files.
   --  Note that this prefix can be overridden by using the GPS_ROOT or
   --  GNAT_ROOT environment variables.

   Host : constant Host_Type := @HOST_TYPE@;
   --  Host kind where GPS is built.
   --  Note: it is in most cases inappropriate to test the value of this
   --  variable and do different things based on it. Consider using this
   --  variable as a last resort, to address very target specific issues.

   Source_Date : constant String := "@GPS_DATE@";

   Max_Frame : constant := 500;
   --  Maximum number of frames displayed in the backtrace window

   Max_Tasks : constant := 999;
   --  Maximum number of tasks/threads displayed in the tasks/threads windows

   Max_PD : constant := 99;
   --  Maximum number of protection domains displayed in the
   --  protection domain window.

   Max_Column_Width : constant := 200;
   --  Maximum width (in pixels) for a column in a list

   Need_To_Strip_CR : constant Boolean := @STRIP_CR@;
   --  True on systems where lines are separated by both LF and CR

   Async_Commands : constant Boolean := True;
   --  True if user commands are handled asynchronousely, to avoid recursion
   --  in the event processing. See design/commands.txt for more details.
   --  This variable is primarily useful for debugging.

   Can_Output : constant Boolean := @CAN_OUTPUT@;
   --  True if gvd can print text on standard output/error, false if gvd
   --  is a GUI only process (e.g under windows).

   Layout_Width : constant := 20;
   --  Width for the area reserved for the buttons in the source/asm editor

   Exec_Command : constant String := "@EXEC_COMMAND@";
   --  Command used to run helpers

   Default_Ps : constant String :=
     "@DEFAULT_PS@";
   --  Command used to list processes on a native system. The String is on
   --  its own line to avoid exceeding line length.

   Default_Print_Cmd : constant String := "@PRINT_CMD@";
   --  Command used to print a file

   Default_Opaque_MDI : constant Boolean := @OPAQUE_MDI@;
   --  Default value for the MDI opaque preference

   Default_Diff_Cmd : constant String := "@DIFF_CMD@";
   --  Command used to generate a diff between two files

   Default_Diff3_Cmd : constant String := "@DIFF3_CMD@";
   --  Command used to generate a diff between three files

   Default_Patch_Cmd : constant String := "@PATCH_CMD@";
   --  Command used to apply a patch file

   Support_Execution_Window : constant Boolean := @EXECUTION_WINDOW@;
   --  Whether separate debugger execution window is supported by the target

   Default_Charset : constant String := "@CHARSET@";
   --  Default charset for the host, used throughout GPS to convert strings
   --  from outside GPS (e.g. pathnames, compiler output, file contents, ...)
   --  to UTF-8 internally.
