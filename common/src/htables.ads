--  Hash table searching routines

--  This package contains two separate packages. The Simple_HTable package
--  provides a very simple abstraction that associates one element to one
--  key value and takes care of all allocations automatically using the heap.
--  The Static_HTable package provides a more complex interface that allows
--  complete control over allocation.

--  This package provides a facility similar to that of GNAT.HTable, except
--  that this package declares types that can be used to define dynamic
--  instances of hash tables, while instantiations of GNAT.HTable create a
--  single instance of the hash table.

--  Note that this interface should remain synchronized with those in
--  GNAT.HTable to keep as much coherency as possible between these two
--  related units.

   -- Static_HTable --
   -------------------

   --  A low-level Hash-Table abstraction, not as easy to instantiate as
   --  Simple_HTable but designed to allow complete control over the
   --  allocation of necessary data structures. Particularly useful when
   --  dynamic allocation is not desired. The model is that each Element
   --  contains its own Key that can be retrieved by Get_Key. Furthermore,
   --  Element provides a link that can be used by the HTable for linking
   --  elements with same hash codes:

   --       Element

   --         +-------------------+
   --         |       Key         |
   --         +-------------------+
   --         :    other data     :
