--  This package is very similar to what is provided by GNAT.Dynamic_Table,

--  do not necessary increment it proportionaly to its current size).

package Dynamic_Arrays is
   --  Data is the type of component stored in the array.
   --  Table_Multiplier and Table_Minimal_Increment are used to specify the
   --  policy used to grow the table: every time the current array is too
   --  small to accomodate a new element, its current size is multiplied
   --  by Table_Multiplier. We then make sure that at least
   --  Table_Minimal_Increment new elements have been added to the table.
   --  Using 1 for Table_Multiplier with result in a constant growth, less
   --  efficient than doubling the size every time, but this saves memory.
   --  Table_Initial_Size specifies the size that should be allocated initially
   --  for the table.
