   --  does not copy the underlying structure.

   type VF_Key is private;
   --  This type holds a key to a file along with its ordered number. This is
   --  automatically updated after each file insertion in the optimizer. The
   --  user do not need to call Get_Key a second time to have the updated
   --  key.

   function Get_Key
     (Opt : Comparison_Optimizer; File : Virtual_File) return VF_Key;
   --  Return the key corresponding to the file given in parameter. If the file
   --  is not yet in the optimizer, it will get added and all the keys will
   --  be updated. This operation is possibly time consuming, as it involves
   --  file comparison, so the result should be cached in order to take
   --  advantage of the optimization.

   function "<" (Left, Right : VF_Key) return Boolean;
   --  Compares two keys. The efficiency of this operation is close to a simple
   --  integer comparison.

   overriding function "=" (Left, Right : VF_Key) return Boolean;
   --  Returns true if the two keys are equals. The efficiency of this
   --  operation is close to a simple integer comparison.
