   --  This type is used to identify the state of an element during the diff
   --  process

   type Diff_Callback is access procedure
     (Old_Obj, New_Obj : Object; State : Diff_State);
   --  This function is called by the generic diff algorithm. Depending on the
   --  value of State, arguments means something different:
   --    Equal:   Old_Obj contains the object from the old container, New_Obj
   --             from the new container. Even if equals regarding the diff
   --             procedures, objects can be distinct in memory.
   --    Added:   Old_Obj is irrelevant, New_Obj contains the value of the
   --             added object in the new container.
   --    Removed: New_Obj is irrelevant, Old_Obj contains the value of the
   --             removed object from the old container.

   procedure Diff
     (Old_Container, New_Container : Container;
      Callback                     : Diff_Callback);
   --  Performs a diff operation between the new and the old container. The
   --  overall complexity of the algoritm is rather high, but optimization is
   --  done to avoid computing diff on the firsts and lasts equals characters.
