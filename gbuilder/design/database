Description and Use of the widget's description database.
========================================================

One of the goals for Radical is for it to be as extensible as possible (and
this as easily as possible of course). Given the number of widgets in gtk+
proper, as well as all the widgets found in the additional libraries that we
might want to support at some point (GNOME, gtkextra, GtkAda, ...), it is
fundamental that adding new widgets to the GUI builder doesn't require a lot of
coding.

The basic idea is thus that each possible widget or component should be
described in a database file, with enough information for the GUI builder and
the code generators to manipulate that widget and generate code for it.

Of course, we still need some code to instantiate the widget and modify its
properties. This code could be automatically generated and compiled from the
high-level description found in the database document.


Contents of the database file
=============================

A lot of information needs to be given in this file (ideally, everything should
be described there, so that the actual code for the GUI builder or the code
generators doesn't have any hard-coded special handling).

Here is a first list of required data:
  - "type name"
  - "type of widget"
    one of "container", "dialog", ... The list should be extensible, for
    instance if we get a "database" widget one day. At the interface level,
    this means that the icon for the widget will go in a notebook page with
    the given name
  - "file"
    header/spec file in which the widget is described. We need to specify
    this for each supported language.
  - "icon"
    icon (file name) to use in the gui builder (tree + widget selection)
  - "new"
    Function (and parameters) to use to create a new instance of the widget.
  - "min_children"
    minimal number of children (0 for non-container widgets)
  - "max_children"
    maximal number of children (0 for non-container widgets, 1 for children
    of Gtk_Bin, -1 for most containers to indicate an unlimited number)
  - "parent"
    name of the parent widget.
  - "interfaces"
    name of the interfaces that the widget implements (gtk+-2.0 only)
  - "signals"
    list of all the new signals defined by that widget type. This should
    include their parameters, return values, ... A documentation string should
    be tolerated, for display in the GUI builder.
  - "properties"
    List of properties of the widget that can be changed at the GUI level. This
    can for instance be the text associated with a label, the icon for a
    button, ... A documentation string should be allowed. A default value should
    be provided whenever appropriate so that the GUI builder can display as
    much information about the widget as possible. Associated with the default
    value, a flag should tell whether the default is known to Gtk+ or to the
    GUI builder only. This will in particular allow code generators to cut their
    output.
    Each property is associated with a list of subprograms used to modify it
    or get its value. Different subprogram names can be given for every
    language.
  - "children_add"
    Function to use to add children. Gtk+'s containers typically have several
    such function (pack_start, pack_end, add, append_widget, ...).
    It might be nice to find of a general way to describe which one should
    preferably be used, and in what cases. For Gtk_Box, Add is a synonym for
    Pack_Start_Defaults.
    There are several additional parameters that might need to be specified
    as well (coordinates for Gtk_Fixed, Shrink for Pack_Start, ...)
  - "children_type"
    name of the ancestor that a child must have. For instance, menus only
    support Menu_Item children, and not general widgets.
  - "style"
    what can be changed in the style (there is no point in changing the
    background of a label for instance, although changing the foreground
    make sense). This could be an indication for the GUI builder to
    transparently generate an intermediate event_box, in case the user has
    chosen to change the background anyway (FAQ for gtk+, would be nice to
    handle automatically).
  - "flags"
    A lot of general flags are needed (can the widget have the focus for
    keyboard events, default event mask,...). These will be integrated as
    we go along.

Format of the database file
===========================

One suggestion is to create one database file per library (ie one for gtk,
one for gtk+extra, ...). This makes handling a little bit easier (no need
to copy several hundreds files). On the other hand, this also means that
finding the actual description of a widget within the file is a little bit
more cumbersome.

As a result, it seems best to allow each file to contains from one to several
widgets, leaving the organization itself to the library maintainer.

Also, to make things more readable, it seems a good idea to allow for fields
to be optional (for instance, non-container widgets do not need to specify
min_children or max_children).

Given all the requirements above, XML seems a very appropriate format.
It allows for optional fields, fields with default values, attributes to
fields, any order, ... And its syntax can be described in XML itself.

See Annex A for technical description of the database, and Annex B for
an example of its use.

??? Remaining issues: Should provide a possibility to have a general
    algorithm to convert subprogram names from one language to another, even
    if it is possible to explicitly give them in the database file.


Interface between the database and the GUI builder
==================================================

A certain number of functions need to be callable from the GUI builder, for
instance to create a new instance of a widget or to get/set its properties.

This "glue code" can be automatically generated from the database file, in
a format suitable for use by the GUI builder. Note that, since the GUI
builder is written in Ada, we only need to generate Ada code for the
interface.

This means that it is very easy to interface to any C widget library (through
pragma Import), but is not possible for other-languages libraries (though
they most probably provide a C interface as well).

The following information at least is needed:

  - Creating a new instance
    That/these functions should take no argument and return the newly created
    widget. Any argument needed by the actual underlying call (for
    gtk_button_new_with_label for instance) is extracted from the required
    fields, as indicated in the database file.

  - Setting properties
    Probably the best way is to have a single function, that takes three
    arguments: the widget, the field name as a string, and a reference to
    the "widget inspector" in the GUI builder. Let that function extract the
    value itself.

  - Destroying an instance and freeing the memory


Interface between the database and the code generators
======================================================

The GUI builder doesn't generate any external code itself. Instead, it
delegates to external code generators.

Each of them will of course read the actual interface from the saved
XML file. However, there is a number of information that they can extract
from the database file, like the list of header files to include when a
widget is used, the function to call to instantiate the widget, ...
This will hopefully make the code generators easier to write.

Note: another possible approach would be to have the code generator also
generic and have all the necessary information in the description file to
generate the code directly.


Annex A: XML Schema description of the format
=============================================

The format below is described in XMLSchema.

??? Unfinished. A number of elements and attributes are not defined yet.

??? Scenario: We create a Gtk_Button (with a default child which is the
    label). If the user modifies the label, it is updated dynamically
    (referencing the child automatically???(1)). If the user sets an icon,
    the child becomes a box with both the child and the icon.
    The problem is to describe this in this database file...

??? We are in fact missing information about all the default children that
    are already there (Gtk_File_Selection), or that are automatically created
    when using certain constructors (gtk_button_new_with_label).
