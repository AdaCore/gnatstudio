--  This package provides the entry point registering all assistants needed
--  by the ada queries.

package Ada_Semantic_Tree.Assistants is

   procedure Register_Ada_Assistants
     (Db                 : Construct_Database_Access;
      Std_Entities_Files : Virtual_File);
   --  This procedure will register all the assistants needed to compute ada
   --  semantics. It has to be invoked before any file is added to the
   --  database, and as soon as possible in the assistant registration. No
   --  query should be made before the assistants have been registered.
   --  If Std_Entities_Files is not No_File, then it should be a path to the
   --  xml file containing pramas / attributes descriptions.
