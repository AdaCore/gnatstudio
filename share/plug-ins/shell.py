"""This plug-in will spawn a Unix/Windows shell console in your GPS

   When spawning zsh, it is recommended that your .zshrc file contains
   the following:
      [[ $EMACS = t ]] && unsetopt zle
   This prevents zsh from duplicating its input to the output, as well
   as some missynchronization between GPS and zsh after a while

   This plugin will filter out ANSI sequences that your shell might be
   writting (for instance colors). These are currently not supported by
   GPS)
