Prototype AUnit integration into Glide.

EF 23-Jan-01

I basically adapted Nicolas' work to get it integrated into Glide.

Status:

1.  Everything builds, and we can create all the AUnit artifacts from an user project.


Wish List:

1.  Incremental addition to a suite without having to completely rebuild it.
2.  Path handling - that is, adding the paths needed at the harness level for all the tests and suites involved into the Glide project.


Installation:

1.  After building the three programs:

aunit_make_harness
aunit_make_suite
aunit_make_test

Move them into the gnat/bin directory. There are makefiles and .adp files in each subdirectory.  The .adp files may need to be modified for directories used.
A master makefile is in the top-level directory.

2.  When building test cases etc, aunit-1.01/aunit/* needs to be in the source and object paths.
