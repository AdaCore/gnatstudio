Prototype AUnit integration into Glide.

Wish List:

1.  Incremental addition to a suite without having to completely rebuild it.
2.  Path handling - that is, adding the paths needed at the harness level for all the tests and suites involved into the Glide project.
3.  Have only one executable instead of three.

Build:

1. type "make -C src"

Installation:

1.  After building the three programs:

aunit_make_harness
aunit_make_suite
aunit_make_test

Move them into the gnat/bin directory.

2.  When building test cases etc, aunit-1.01/aunit/* needs to be in the source
    and object paths.
