This repository groups all the tools and components provided by
Glide 2.

Since Glide groups many tools, some of them have their own repository
such as GtkAda and GVD.

Some of the tools need additional sources to compile:
  - hypergrep:
    Put a link called "gvd" in the directory that contains this README file.
    The link should point to the top-level directory of the GVD sources

  - prj_editor:
    Put a link called "gnat" in the directory that contains this README file.
    The link should point to the src/ada directory in the GNAT sources.
    This tool requires at least GNAT 3.15

All the tools need access to an installed version of GtkAda. Make sure that
gtkada-config is found in your PATH.

Building Glide 2
=================

You need to execute the following command in the directory that contains this
README file:
    ./configure --prefix=<prefix_dir>

This is needed to automatically generate some of the required sources and
Makefiles.
For best compatibility with GNAT, <prefix_dir> should be the value
returned by `gnatls -v`, minus the "adainclude" at the end.

Then go to the directory of the tool you want to build and execute the
following commands:
     make
     make install
