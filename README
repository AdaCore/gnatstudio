This repository groups all the tools and components provided by
Glide 2.

Since Glide groups many tools, some of them have their own repository
such as GtkAda and GVD.

Some of the tools need additional sources to compile, so you need to set up
the following directories/links:
- Copy/Move the top-level directory of the GVD sources in the directory that
  contains this README file.
  Using a link will work, except when using the project files.

- Put a link called "gnat_src" in the directory that contains this README file.
  The link should point to the src/ada directory in the GNAT sources.
  This tool requires at least GNAT 3.15.

- Put a link called "gtkada" in the directory that contains this README file.
  The link should point to the top level GtkAda source directory.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: you need to use the same version of GNAT sources and binaries.

All the tools need access to an installed version of GtkAda 2.0 (GtkAda 1.2
won't work with Glide 2). Make sure that the proper gtkada-config is found in
your PATH.

The directory containing this README (usually called glidiator if taken
fresh from CVS) should look like:

aunit/
browsers/
common/
gbuilder/
glide/
gnat/
gnat_src -> /home/my_account/gnat/src/ada
gtkada -> /home/my_account/gtk/GtkAda
gvd/
hypergrep/
kernel/
prj_editor/
src_editor/
syntax/
vcs/
vdiff/

Building Glide 2
=================

After having configured and installed Gtkada,
you need to execute the following commands in the directory that contains this
README file:
    [glidiator] $ ./configure --prefix=<prefix_dir>
    [glidiator] $ cd gvd
    [glidiator/gvd] $ ./configure --prefix=<prefix_dir>
    [glidiator/gvd] $ cd ..

This is needed to automatically generate some of the required sources and
Makefiles.
For best compatibility with GNAT, <prefix_dir> should be same as the
prefix used for building GNAT.

Then do a make in the top level directory:

    [glidiator] $ make
