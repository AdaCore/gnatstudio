This repository groups all the tools and components provided by
Glide 2.

Since Glide groups many tools, some of them have their own repository
such as GtkAda and GVD.

Some of the tools need additional sources to compile:
  - hypergrep:
    Put a link called "gvd" in the directory that contains this README file.
    The link should point to the top-level directory of the GVD sources

  - prj_editor:
    Put a link called "gnat" in the directory that contains this README file.
    The link should point to the src/ada directory in the GNAT sources.
    This tool requires at least GNAT 3.15

All the tools need access to an installed version of GtkAda. Make sure that
gtkada-config is found in your PATH.
