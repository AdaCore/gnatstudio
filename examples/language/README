This directory contains the required specification for the C and Ada languages
to implement the custom language functions, as described in the documentation.

- language_custom.ads is the Ada spec file
- language_custom.h is the C spec file
- gprcustom.c is an example file showing a possible C implementation of the 
  functions Comment_Line and Uncomment_Line for the GPS project files (.gpr
  files), or any other Ada-like language.
- Makefile is a simple Makefile for building libgprcustom.so on most unix
  systems.
