This directory contains the required specification for the C and Ada languages
to implement the custom language functions, as described in the documentation.

- language_custom.ads is the Ada spec file
- language_custom.h is the C spec file
- gpr_custom.ad{s,b} are example files showing a possible Ada implementation
  of the functions Comment_Line and Uncomment_Line for the GPS project files
  (.gpr files), or any other Ada-like language.
- gprcustom.c is the C version of gpr_custom.adb
- Makefile is a simple Makefile for building libgprcustom.so on most unix
  systems.
