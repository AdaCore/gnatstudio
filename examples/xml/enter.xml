<!--
  This file binds the Shift-Return key so that it just
  inserts a newline character, but not do auto-reindent the
  current line first, as opposed to what Return does.

  One usage is if you want some parts of your code to have some
  special indentation that doesn't match what the automatic
  indentation engine tries to do.

  To use:
     Copy this file in ~/.gps/plug-ins/

<enter>
   <action name="newline no auto-indent" category="Editor">
      <shell>current_context</shell>
      <shell>FileContext.file %1</shell>
      <shell>File.name %1</shell>
      <shell>Editor.cursor_get_line %1</shell>
      <shell>Editor.cursor_get_column %2</shell>

" 0 0</shell>
      <filter id="Source editor" />
   </action>

   <key action="newline no auto-indent">shift-Return</key>
