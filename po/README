Adding translations for GPS
==========================

- The first step is to add an entry to the LANGS variable in the Makefile
  The name of the language should be similar to "fr_FR", "en_US", ie the
  abbrev for a language and a country code

- Then run
    make refresh

- This generates a <lang>.po file. You can then edit all the translations in
  that file. If you need to update that file after changes in the code, run
    make refresh
  again, and it will keep your existing translations and merge in the new
  strings to be translated.

- Then proceed with
    make install
  which generates a binary file <lang>.mo, and installs it in the GPS
  installation directory.

- Set the environment variable LANG to the name of the language you have
  created.

- Restart GPS


Translation should also include XML files which have user-visible strings,
although we haven't fully defined yet how to handle that automatically

Translation should include the strings from GtkAda
