   --  If Quiet is true:
   --    - files are not saved before build launch
   --    - the console is not raised when launching the build
   --    - the console is not cleared when launching the build
   --  If Synchronous is True, GPS will block until the command is terminated.
   --  See document of Dialog_Mode for details on Dialog values.
   --  Via_Menu is true iff the target was launched via the global menu.
   --  If Preserve_Output is true, Messages view will not be cleared.

   --  Main, if not empty, indicates the main to build.
   --  It belongs to the Main_Project projec (important in case we are using
   --  aggregate projects)
   --
   --  If Directory is not empty, indicates which directory the target should
   --  be run under. Default is the project's directory.
   --  If Background, run the compile in the background.
   --  On_Exit is the subprogram which should be called upon exit.
