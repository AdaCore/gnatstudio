Issues with order of libraries when linking.

If project are mutually dependent, you can end up with undefined symbols
when linking using the Makefile.generic approach, because we link with
archive files, and symbols inside each archive may depend in a mutual way
on objects in other archives.

Current approach:
- create an archive for each project, and link with them once
  - pros: only needed objects are linked
          avoid command line limitations
  - cons: may get unresolved symbols, depending on order and lib dependencies
          need to recreate the archive each time a file in the project modified

Possible solutions are:
- create an archive for each project and link with them twice
  that is, once in the default (recursive top-down) order, and once in the
  reverse order
  - pros: more symbols resolved
          only needed objects are linked
          avoid command line limitation (to a certain extent)
  - cons: would not resolve all symbols in all cases.
          need to recreate the archive each time

- specify all objects on the command line instead
  - pros: all symbols resolved
  - cons: can hit command line length limit easily
          all objects always linked

- create a relocatable object for each project
  - pros: all symbols resolved
          avoid command line limitations
  - cons: all objects always linked
          need to recreate the relocatable object each time a file is modified

- create a global archive at link time
  - pros: all symbols resolved
          only needed objects are linked
          avoid command line limitations
  - cons: longer link time

Last solution looks to me to be the right one, unless there is a better
option I haven't listed.

Implementation issues:

- to avoid the command line length limitation, we want to build the
  archive incrementally, project by project.
  -> use the same recursive mechanism used for e.g. the compile target

- tricky: we want to rebuild this global archive only when needed, which is
  difficult to know, since the objects are spread amongst several projects.
  Consider using stamp files, but these are hard to get completely right
  (see gcc makefile).
