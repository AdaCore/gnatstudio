--  <description>
--  This widget provides an advanced file selection dialog.
--
--  This widget provides a directory explorer as well as a file explorer.
--  The user decides which files should be viewed in the file explorer
--  by selecting a filter.
--
--  User-defined filters can be created by inheriting from
--  File_Filter_Record and overriding Use_File_Filter.
--
--  Before this widget can be used, any filters must be registered
--  using Register_Filter.
--
--  For a basic usage, the typical code would be:
--
--  procedure Run_File_Selector is
--     File_Selector_Window : File_Selector_Window_Access;
--     Filter_A : Filter_Show_All_Access := new Filter_Show_All;
--  begin
--     Gtk.Main.Init;
--     Gtk_New (File_Selector_Window, "/");
--
--     Register_Filter (File_Selector_Window, Filter_A);
--
--     Show_All (File_Selector_Window);
--     Gtk.Main.Main;
--     Free (Filter_A);
--  end Run_Test_File_Selector;
--
--  To handle the most common cases, a function Select_File is provided that
--  installs automatically default filters, and runs the main loop for you.
--
