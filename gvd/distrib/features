New features in GVD 1.0.1

- Better internalization handling
  Some duplicate strings have been merged.
- Complete french translation available
- Instead of generating a bug box when the underlying debugger dies, GVD
  now properly closes the debugger window and notifies the user.
- Basic support for JDB. No support for displaying variables yet.
- New command line option: --jdb to enable jdb support.
- New command line option: --no-explorer to disable the explorer window.
- New command line switch: --target to specify the target host and protocol.
- Better recovering after a bug box
  In particular, the cursor no longer looks busy after a bug box.
- Better handling of the explorer tree. Previous implementation was too
  costly and caused very long start up times on slow machines with executable
  containing lots of files.
