Known Problems fixed in GVD 1.2.0

- Load a module on the debugger console does not update the explorer
  Problem:    When using the load or file command in the debugger console
              window, the source explorer is not updated.

  Workaround: Either load using the File->Open Program... menu, or use the
              "Reload Sources" in the explorer contextual menu.

- Displaying list of tasks on a non running program.
  Problem:    Opening the menu Data->Tasks... will generate a bug box when the
              program being debugged has not been started or is terminated.

  Workaround: Close the task window when the program is not running.

- [8715-002] Explorer does not handle files starting with no comment/blank line
  Problem:    GVD will generate a bug box when trying to open in the explorer
              window a package that starts with no blank or comment line.

  Workaround: Add a comment or blank line at the beginning of the package.

- Parsing Ada exported variables in C
  Problem:    GVD will generate a bug box when trying to display in C mode
              a variable declared in Ada.

  Workaround: Set the language to Ada before displaying the variable.

- Parsing unconstrained Ada arrays
  Problem:    Some arrays are incorrectly displayed by GVD, and all the items
              appear to have an index equal to 0.

  Workaround: Try to display a slice of the array ("graph display A(2..5)")

- Display the manual with no open debugger
  Problem:    It isn't possible to display the GVD manual (from the menu
              Help->Manual) when no debugger is currently open.

  Workaround: Open a new debugger with the menu Files->Open Debugger

- Parsing C++ classes with virtual methods
  Problem:    When a class defines virtual methods, it has an extra invisible
              fields that breaks the display in the canvas.

  Workaround: Use the tooltips to examine the class

- Parsing C++ classes with no field
  Problem:    Gvd isn't able to correctly parse C++ classes that do not define
              any new field, but only methods.

  Workaround: Use the tooltips to examine the class


Known Problems fixed in GVD 1.1.0

- Tooltips are not always shown.
  Problem:    When starting the debugged program using the debugger console
              window (by e.g typing "run"), the tooltips are not activated.

  Workaround: Use the "Run" or "Start" buttons instead of using the console
              window.

- Dereferencing Ada string parameters
  Problem:    When trying to display/dereference the value of a string
              parameter or of a string access in the canvas, this creates a
              self-pointing link to the value, and it is not possible to see
              the value of the string.

  Workaround: Disable alias detection in the canvas, or display parameter.all
              explicitely.

- [8524-010] Refresh problem in the canvas on NT
  Problem:    When big items are moved in the canvas on NT, there appears some
              black areas which are incorrectly refreshed.

  Workaround: Force a refresh of the canvas, by iconizing the GVD window and
              de-iconizing it afterwards.

- ASM view does not work properly
  Problem:    When switching the source editor to Asm only mode, GVD generates
              error messages on standard output and does not handle properly
              the windows when switching back to Source mode.

  Workaround: Use the Asm+Source mode instead.

- [8524-008] Cannot call the editor under NT
  Problem:    When using the File->Edit Current Source menu under NT, GVD
              launches the external editor using forward slashes instead of
              backslashes.

  Workaround: Use an editor that understands forward slashes.

- Loading a non existant executable generates a bug box
  Problem:    When using the File->Open Program... menu and specifying
              a non existant file, GVD generates a bug box instead of
              reporting the error in the status bar.

  Workaround: The error can safely be ignored.

- Wrong command line "--log-level" not handled properly
  Problem:    When specifying the --log-level option with no parameter,
              GVD generates a bug box instead of displaying the help
              text.

  Workaround: Use proper syntax for --log-level argument.

- Support for CR characters on Unix systems
  Problem:    GVD can not correctly detect whether a file contains CR
              characters unless it is on a Windows system. This results in the
              current line being incorrectly highlighted in the source
              editor.

  Workaround: Strip the CR characters from the files before using them.
 
- [8531-006] --no-explorer option generates a bug box
  Problem:    When using the --no-explorer command line option, GVD generates
              an assert failure.

  Workaround: Do not use the --no-explorer option, or create a file
              $HOME/.gvd/preferences containing the following lines:
 
              <?xml version="1.0"?>
              <preferences>
                <Display_Explorer>FALSE</Display_Explorer>
              </preferences>

- Parsing of unsigned char variables.
  Problem:    When trying to display an unsigned char, GVD recurses infinitely.
  Workaround: Use the tooltips or the command window to display such variables.

- [8511-011] Parsing of Ada variant records with null part.
  Problem:    Variant records that have at least one alternative with a null
              part are incorrectly parsed (parsing error, nothing displayed in
              the canvas).

  Workaround: Use the tooltips in the source window to look at the value of
              the variable.

- Closing of the first of multiple debuggers.
  Problem:    When multiple debuggers are present, closing the first one raises
              an error.

  Workaround: No workaround for this problem, fixed in GVD 1.1.0.


Known Problems fixed in GVD 1.0.2

- [8325-005] Interrupt button does not work under Windows
  Problem:    Hitting the 'Interrupt' button does nothing under windows
              systems.

  Workaround: Use breakpoints instead to stop the underlying process.

- Cancel in File->Open Program does not work properly
  Problem:    Hitting the 'Cancel' button causes GVD to ask the debugger
              to open the '' program. One symptom is, when a program was
              already open, a question from gdb asking whether the symbols
              from the previous program should be discarded.

  Workaround: Do not press on the 'Cancel' button :-)

- [8408-001] Attach command in the debugger window does not start gvd properly
  Problem:    When typing the attach, load or add-symbol-file command in the
              debugger window, some functionalities like 'Display Files in
              Shared Libraries' are not enabled.

  Workaround: Use the menus instead, or click on the run button.

- Parsing of char* fields in C structs
  Problem:    The value of string fields in C structures is incorrectly parsed,
              and extended till the end of the line. As a result, the following
              fields are empty.

  Workaround: The value of the following fields is still visible, but not at
              the correct location.

- Parsing of array fields in C structs
  Problem:    Fields that are arrays of simple types (int, double,...) are
              incorrectly detected.

  Workaround: Look at the value of the variable directly in the source window
              through the tooltips.

- Current line highlighted with an offset
  Problem:    If the previous current line contained some tabs, then the next
              one is highlighted with an offset.

  Workaround: Force a redisplay of the source window (hide line numbers).

- Wrong handling of double in C structs.
  Problem:    When trying to display a C structure containing a double, GVD
              recurses infinitely, causing a stack overflow.

  Workaround: Print such variables in the debugger window instead.

- Incorrect highlighting of ex-current line
  Problem:    When the current line (with green background) changes, the
              previous one is incorrectly syntax-highlighted (comments are
              still in black).

  Workaround: Force a redisplay of the source window (for instance hide line
              numbers and display them again)

- Opening the preferences dialog multiple times
  Problem:    If the preferences dialog is closed with the title bar's X
              button, it isn't possible to reopen it afterwards.

  Workaround: Close the dialog with the Cancel button

- [8327-010] NT directory separators not handled properly in the command line.
  Problem:    When specifying an executable on the command line that contains
              backslashes under NT, GVD does not handle it properly.

  Workaround: Replace blackslashes by slashes, or use the menu File/Open
              Program instead.

- [8327-009] Highlighting misspelled in the Preferences dialog
  Problem:    Color Highlighting is mispelled in the preferences dialog.

  Workaround: None, this is a minor inconvenience with no consequences.

- Command line arguments --version and --help do not work under Windows.
  Problem:    When using the --version or --help command line option under
              windows systems, gvd starts and nothing happens.

  Workaround: No work around, either ignore this minor problem or use 1.0.2


Known Problems fixed in GVD 1.0.1

- Start with arguments
  Problem:    When starting a program with non null arguments, gvd only
              sets the arguments and does not actually start the program.

  Workaround: Set the arguments first, and then start the application

- Attaching to a process
  Problem:    When trying to attach using the File/Attach menu, GVD fails
              to attach to the process.

  Workaround: Attach by hand by using the attach command in the debugger window.

- Call stack not displayed after an attach
  Problem:    When trying to attach using the File/Attach menu, GVD fails
              to display the current call stack.

  Workaround: Either switch from one debugger to another, and back to the
              first one will force redisplay of the call stack. Any execution
              command (step, next, ...) will also trigger the call stack
              display.

- Task window does not display the last task name properly
  Problem:    The last task name in the task window is truncated by one
              character.

  Workaround: This is a small cosmetic problem that does not require any work
              around.

- Closing the attach process window would generate a bug box
  Problem:    When closing the attach process window using the close icon of
              the window manager, GVD generates a bug box instead of
              silently closing the window.

  Workaround: Use the close button instead.

- File/Edit Source is silently ignored
  Problem:    When using the File/Edit Source menu, nothing happens.

  Workaround: Set the environment variable GVD_EDITOR (e.g
              "xterm -e /bin/vi %f +%l") before launching gvd.

- Problem in the memory view address handling
  Problem:    In the memory view, when specifying some array variables whose
              bounds are unknown to gdb in the Address area, gvd hangs.

  Workaround: Do not try to display memory associated to arrays with non
              static bounds.

- Special characters not properly handled in file and directory names
  Problem:    GVD does not handle files containing special characters such as
              '!' or ' '.

  Workaround: Avoid using these characters, by e.g using links.

- Adding a breakpoint in the Breakpoint window would generate a bug box
  Problem:    When clicking on the Add button in the edit breakpoint window,
              gvd generates a Constraint_Error turned into a bug box.

  Workaround: Set breakpoints using the source code window or the debugger
              window instead.

- Incorrect highlighting with TAB characters in comments
  Problem:    Highlighting is incorrect for files containing tab characters
              inside comments.

  Workaround: Ignore the highlighting, or remove tabs from comments.

- Under Windows NT/2000, GVD would crash on directory selection
  Problem:    When using the "File/Change Directory" menu item under NT/2000,
              GVD generates a bug box.

  Workaround: Type the directory name explicitely without any pending
              slash/backslashes or use the "cd" command in the debugger window.
