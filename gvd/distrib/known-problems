Known Problems in GVD 1.0.1

- Parsing of char* fields in C structs
  Problem: the value of string fields in C structures was incorrectly parsed,
           and extended till the end of the line. As a result, the following
           fields were empty.
  Workaround: The value of the following fields is still visible, but not at
           the correct location
  Status: Fixed in GVD 1.0.2

- Parsing of array fields in C structs
  Problem: fields that are arrays of simple types (int, double,...) were
           incorrectly detected.
  Workaround: Look at the value of the variable directly in the source window
           through the tooltips
  Status: Fixed in GVD 1.0.2

- Current line highlighted with an offset
  Problem: If the previous current line contained some tabs, then the next
           one is highlighted with an offset.
  Woraround: Force a redisplay of the source window (hide line numbers)
  Status: Fixed in GVD 1.0.2

- Wrong handling of double in C structs.
  Problem:
     When trying to display a C structure containing a double, GVD would
     recurse infinitely, causing a stack overflow.
  Workaround:
     Print such variables in the debugger window instead.
  Status: Fixed in GVD 1.0.2

- Incorrect highlighting of ex-current line
  Problem: When the current line (with green background) changes, the previous
           one is incorrectly syntax-highlighted (comments are still in black)
  Workaround: force a redisplay of the source window (for instance hide line
           numbers and display them again)
  Status: Fixed in GVD 1.0.2

- Opening the preferences dialog multiple times
  Problem: If the preferences dialog was closed with the title bar's X button,
           it wasn't possible to reopen it afterwards.
  Workaround: Close the dialog with the Cancel button
  Status: Fixed in GVD 1.0.2

- [8327-010] NT directory separators not handled properly in the command line.
  Problem:
     When specifying an executable on the command line that contains
     backslashes under NT, GVD did not properly handle it.
  Workaround:
     Replace blackslashes by slashes, or use the menu File/Open Program instead
  Status: Fixed in GVD 1.0.2

- [8327-009] Highligthing misspelled in the Preferences dialog
  Problem:
     Color Highlighting is mispelled in the preferences dialog.
  Workaround:
     None, this is a minor inconvenience with no consequences.
  Status: Fixed in GVD 1.0.2

- Command line arguments --version and --help do not work under Windows.
  Problem:
     When using the --version or --help command line option under windows
     systems, gvd starts and nothing happens.
  Workaround:
     No work around, either ignore this minor problem or use 1.0.2
  Status: Fixed in GVD 1.0.2

Known Problems in GVD 1.0.0

- Start with arguments
  Problem:
     When starting a program with non null arguments, gvd would only set the
     arguments and not actually start the program.
  Workaround:
     Set the arguments first, and then start the application
  Status: Fixed in GVD 1.0.1

- Attaching to a process
  Problem:
     When trying to attach using the File/Attach menu, GVD would fail to
     attach to the process.
  Workaround:
     Attach by hand by using the attach command in the debugger window.
  Status: Fixed in GVD 1.0.1

- Call stack not displayed after an attach
  Problem:
     When trying to attach using the File/Attach menu, GVD would fail to
     display the current call stack.
  Workaround:
     Either switch from one debugger to another, and back to the first one
     will force redisplay of the call stack. Any execution command (step, next,
     ...) will also trigger the call stack display.
  Status: Fixed in GVD 1.0.1

- Task window does not display the last task name properly
  Problem:
     The last task name in the task window was truncated by one character
  Workaround:
     This is a small cosmetic problem that does not require any work around
  Status: Fixed in GVD 1.0.1

- Closing the attach process window would generate a bug box
  Problem:
     When closing the attach process window using the close icon of the window
     manager, GVD would generate a bug box instead of silently close the
     window
  Workaround:
     Use the close button instead.
  Status: Fixed in GVD 1.0.1

- File/Edit Source is silently ignored
  Problem:
     When using the File/Edit Source menu, nothing would happen.
  Workaround:
     Set the environment variable GVD_EDITOR (e.g "xterm -e /bin/vi %f +%l")
     before launching gvd.
  Status: Fixed in GVD 1.0.1

- Problem in the memory view address handling
  Problem:
     In the memory view, when specifying some array variables whose bounds are
     unknown to gdb in the Address area, gvd would hang.
  Workaround:
     Do not try to display memory associated to arrays with non static bounds.
  Status: Fixed in GVD 1.0.1

- Special characters not properly handled in file and directory names
  Problem:
     GVD did not handle files containing special characters such as '!' or ' '
  Workaround:
     Avoid using these characters, by e.g using links.
  Status: Fixed in GVD 1.0.1

- Adding a breakpoint in the Breakpoint window would generate a bug box
  Problem:
     When clicking on the Add button in the edit breakpoint window, gvd would
     generate a Constraint_Error turned into a bug box.
  Workaround:
     Set breakpoints using the source code window or the debugger window
     instead.
  Status: Fixed in GVD 1.0.1

- Incorrect highlighting with TAB characters in comments
  Problem:
     Highlighting was incorrect for files containing tab characters inside
     comments.
  Workaround:
     Ignore the highlighting, or remove tabs from comments.
  Status: Fixed in GVD 1.0.1

- Under Windows NT/2000, GVD would crash on directory selection
  Problem:
     When using the "File/Change Directory" menu item under NT/2000, GVD
     would generate a bug box.
  Workaround:
     Type the directory name explicitely without any pending slash/backslashes
     or use the "cd" command in the debugger window.
  Status: Fixed in GVD 1.0.1
