~"\n"
~"    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n"
~"    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n"
~"    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n"
~"    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n"
~"    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n"
~"    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n"
~"    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n"
~"    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n"
~"    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n"
~"    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n"
~"    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n"
~"\n"
~"    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n"
~"    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n"
~"    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n"
~"    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n"
~"    with subsection 6b.\n"
~"\n"
~"    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n"
~"    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n"
~"    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n"
~"    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n"
~"    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n"
~"    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n"
~"    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n"
~"    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n"
~"    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n"
~"    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n"
~"    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n"
~"    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n"
~"\n"
~"    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n"
~"    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n"
~"    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n"
~"    charge under subsection 6d.\n"
~"\n"
~"  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\n"
~"from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\n"
~"included in conveying the object code work.\n"
~"\n"
~"  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\n"
~"tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\n"
~"or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\n"
~"into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\n"
~"doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\n"
~"product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\n"
~"typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\n"
~"of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\n"
~"actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\n"
~"is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\n"
~"commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\n"
~"the only significant mode of use of the product.\n"
~"\n"
~"  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\n"
~"procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\n"
~"and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\n"
~"a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\n"
~"suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\n"
~"code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\n"
~"modification has been made.\n"
~"\n"
~"  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\n"
~"specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\n"
~"part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\n"
~"User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\n"
~"fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\n"
~"Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\n"
~"by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\n"
~"if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\n"
~"modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\n"
~"been installed in ROM).\n"
~"\n"
~"  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\n"
~"requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\n"
~"for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\n"
~"the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\n"
~"network may be denied when the modification itself materially and\n"
~"adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\n"
~"protocols for communication across the network.\n"
~"\n"
~"  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\n"
~"in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\n"
~"documented (and with an implementation available to the public in\n"
~"source code form), and must require no special password or key for\n"
~"unpacking, reading or copying.\n"
~"\n"
~"  7. Additional Terms.\n"
~"\n"
~"  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\n"
~"License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\n"
~"Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\n"
~"be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\n"
~"that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\n"
~"apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\n"
~"under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\n"
~"this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n"
~"\n"
~"  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\n"
~"remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\n"
~"it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n"
~"removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\n"
~"additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\n"
~"for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n"
~"\n"
~"  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\n"
~"add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\n"
~"that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n"
~"\n"
~"    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n"
~"    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n"
~"\n"
~"    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n"
~"    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n"
~"    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n"
~"\n"
~"    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n"
~"    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n"
~"    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n"
~"\n"
~"    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n"
~"    authors of the material; or\n"
~"\n"
~"    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n"
~"    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n"
~"\n"
~"    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n"
~"    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n"
~"    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n"
~"    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n"
~"    those licensors and authors.\n"
~"\n"
~"  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\n"
~"restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\n"
~"received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\n"
~"governed by this License along with a term that is a further\n"
~"restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\n"
~"a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\n"
~"License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\n"
~"of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\n"
~"not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n"
~"\n"
~"  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\n"
~"must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\n"
~"additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\n"
~"where to find the applicable terms.\n"
~"\n"
~"  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\n"
~"form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\n"
~"the above requirements apply either way.\n"
~"\n"
~"  8. Termination.\n"
~"\n"
~"  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\n"
~"provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\n"
~"modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\n"
~"this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\n"
~"paragraph of section 11).\n"
~"\n"
~"  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n"
~"license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n"
~"provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\n"
~"finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\n"
~"holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\n"
~"prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n"
~"\n"
~"  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n"
~"reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\n"
~"violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\n"
~"received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\n"
~"copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n"
~"your receipt of the notice.\n"
~"\n"
~"  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n"
~"licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\n"
~"this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\n"
~"reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\n"
~"material under section 10.\n"
~"\n"
~"  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n"
~"\n"
~"  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n"
~"run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n"
~"occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n"
~"to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\n"
~"nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\n"
~"modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\n"
~"not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n"
~"covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n"
~"\n"
~"  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n"
~"\n"
~"  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n"
~"receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n"
~"propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\n"
~"for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n"
~"\n"
~"  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\n"
~"organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\n"
~"organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\n"
~"work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n"
~"transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n"
~"licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\n"
~"give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n"
~"Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\n"
~"the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n"
~"\n"
~"  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n"
~"rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\n"
~"not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\n"
~"rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n"
~"(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\n"
~"any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\n"
~"sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n"
~"\n"
~"  11. Patents.\n"
~"\n"
~"  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n"
~"License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\n"
~"work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n"
~"\n"
~"  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\n"
~"owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\n"
~"hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\n"
~"by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\n"
~"but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\n"
~"consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\n"
~"purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\n"
~"patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\n"
~"this License.\n"
~"\n"
~"  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n"
~"patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\n"
~"make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\n"
~"propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n"
~"\n"
~"  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\n"
~"agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n"
~"(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\n"
~"sue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\n"
~"party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\n"
~"patent against the party.\n"
~"\n"
~"  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n"
~"and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n"
~"to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\n"
~"publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\n"
~"then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\n"
~"available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\n"
~"patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\n"
~"consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\n"
~"license to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\n"
~"actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\n"
~"covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\n"
~"in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\n"
~"country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n"
~"\n"
~"  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n"
~"arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\n"
~"covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\n"
~"receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\n"
~"or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\n"
~"you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\n"
~"work and works based on it.\n"
~"\n"
~"  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\n"
~"the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\n"
~"conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\n"
~"specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\n"
~"work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\n"
~"in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\n"
~"to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\n"
~"the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\n"
~"parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\n"
~"patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\n"
~"conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\n"
~"for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\n"
~"contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\n"
~"or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n"
~"\n"
~"  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\n"
~"any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\n"
~"otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n"
~"\n"
~"  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n"
~"\n"
~"  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n"
~"otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n"
~"excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\n"
~"covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n"
~"License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\n"
~"not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\n"
~"to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\n"
~"the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\n"
~"License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n"
~"\n"
~"  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n"
~"\n"
~"  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n"
~"permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n"
~"under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\n"
~"combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\n"
~"License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\n"
~"but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\n"
~"section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\n"
~"combination as such.\n"
~"\n"
~"  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n"
~"\n"
~"  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\n"
~"the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n"
~"be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n"
~"address new problems or concerns.\n"
~"\n"
~"  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\n"
~"Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\n"
~"Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\n"
~"option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\n"
~"version or of any later version published by the Free Software\n"
~"Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\n"
~"GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\n"
~"by the Free Software Foundation.\n"
~"\n"
~"  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\n"
~"versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\n"
~"public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\n"
~"to choose that version for the Program.\n"
~"\n"
~"  Later license versions may give you additional or different\n"
~"permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\n"
~"author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\n"
~"later version.\n"
