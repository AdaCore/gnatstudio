--  This package provides a set of subprograms that give high level access
--  to OS functionnalities.

with GNAT.OS_Lib; use GNAT.OS_Lib;

package OS_Utils is

   function Executable_Location return String;
   --  Return the name of the parent directory where the executable is stored.
   --  The executable must be located in a directory called "bin". Thus, if
   --  the executable is stored in directory "/foo/bar/bin", this routine
   --  returns "/foo/bar/". If the executable is not stored in a directory
   --  "bin" (casing is unimportant) then a null string is returned.

   function Is_Directory_Separator (C : Character) return Boolean;
   --  Returns True if C is a directory separator

   procedure Set_OpenVMS_Host (Setting : Boolean := True);
   --  Set whether the host is an OpenVMS host.

   function Max_Path_Len return Natural;
   --  Return the maximum length of a pathname for the current host.

   type Idle_Callback is access procedure;
   --  Callback procedure called by Spawn while waiting the inferior.

   procedure Spawn
     (Program_Name : String;
      Args         : Argument_List;
      Idle         : Idle_Callback;
      Success      : out Boolean);
   --  Similar to GNAT.OS_Lib.Spawn, but call Idle periodically while waiting.

   function Read_File (File : String) return String_Access;
   --  Return the contents of an entire file.
   --  If the file cannot be found, return null.
   --  The caller is responsible for freeing the returned memory.

   type Ctrl_C_Handler is access procedure;
   --  Any parameterless library level procedure can be used as a handler.
   --  Ctrl_C_Handler should not propagate exceptions.

   procedure Install_Ctrl_C_Handler (Handler : Ctrl_C_Handler);
   --  Set up Handler to be called if the operator hits Ctrl-C.

   procedure Uninstall_Ctrl_C_Handler;
   --  Reinstall the standard Control-C handler.
   --  If Install_Handler has never been called, this procedure has no effect.

private

   pragma Import (C, Uninstall_Ctrl_C_Handler, "__gnat_uninstall_int_handler");
