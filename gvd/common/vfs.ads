     (Ada.Calendar.Year_Number'First,

      Ada.Calendar.Day_Number'First);

   subtype UTF8_String_Access is GNAT.OS_Lib.String_Access;
   type Cst_UTF8_String_Access is access constant Glib.UTF8_String;

   function Create (Full_Filename : UTF8_String) return Virtual_File;
   --  Return a file, given its full filename.
   --  The latter can be found, for source files, through the functions in
   --  projects-registry.ads.

   function Create_From_Base (Base_Name : UTF8_String) return Virtual_File;
   --  Return a file, given its base name.
   --  The full name will never be computable. Consider using Projects.Create
   --  if you know to which project the file belongs. Also consider using
   --  Glide_Kernel.Create
   --
   --  ??? Currently, this does the same thing as create, but it is
   --  preferable to distinguish both cases just in case.

   function Is_Regular_File (File : Virtual_File) return Boolean;
   --  Whether File corresponds to an actual file on the disk.
   --  This also works for remote files.

   function "=" (File1, File2 : Virtual_File) return Boolean;
   --  Overloading of the standard operator

   function "<" (File1, File2 : Virtual_File) return Boolean;
   --  Compare two files, possibly case insensitively on file systems that
   --  require this.

   function Base_Name
     (File : Virtual_File; Suffix : String := "") return Glib.UTF8_String;
   --  Return the base name of the file.

   function Full_Name
     (File : Virtual_File; Normalize : Boolean := False)
      return Cst_UTF8_String_Access;
   --  Return the full path to File
   --  If Normalize is True, the file name is first normalized, and links
   --  are resolved on systems where it applies.
   --  The returned value can be used to recreate a Virtual_File instance.
   --  If file names are case insensitive, the normalized name will always
   --  be all lower cases.

   function URL_File_Name (File : Virtual_File) return String;
   --  Return the file name as an URL. Local files do not use the URL
   --  notation, and their full name is returned instead

   function File_Extension (File : Virtual_File) return UTF8_String;
   --  Return the extension of the file, or the empty string if there is no
   --  extension. This extension includes the last dot and all the following
   --  characters;

   function Dir_Name (File : Virtual_File) return Cst_UTF8_String_Access;
   --  Return the directory name for File

   function Read_File (File : Virtual_File) return GNAT.OS_Lib.String_Access;
   --  Return the contents of an entire file, encoded with the locale encoding.
   --  If the file cannot be found, return null.
   --  The caller is responsible for freeing the returned memory.
   --  This works transparently for remote files

   procedure Delete (File : Virtual_File);
   --  Remove file from the disk. This also works for remote files

   function Is_Writable (File : Virtual_File) return Boolean;
   --  Return True if File is writable

   function Is_Directory (File : Virtual_File) return Boolean;
   --  Return True if File is in fact a directory

   function Is_Absolute_Path (File : Virtual_File) return Boolean;
   --  Return True if File contains an absolute path name, False if it only
   --  contains the base name or a relative name.

   procedure Set_Writable (File : VFS.Virtual_File; Writable : Boolean);
   --  If Writable is True, make File writable, otherwise make File unwritable.

   procedure Set_Readable (File : VFS.Virtual_File; Readable : Boolean);
   --  If Readable is True, make File readable, otherwise make File unreadable.

   function File_Time_Stamp
     (File : Virtual_File) return Ada.Calendar.Time;
   --  Return the timestamp for this file.
   --  Note: we do not return GNAT.OS_Lib.OS_Time, since the latter cannot be
   --  created by anyone, and is just a private type.
   --  If the file doesn't exist, No_Time is returned.

--   procedure Define_Translation
--     (Host_Dir : String; Remote_Dir : String);
   --  Defines a translation for file names: any occurrence of Host_Dir at
   --  the beginning of the file name will be replaced by Remote_Dir.

   procedure Sort (Files : in out File_Array);
   --  Sort the array of files, in the order given by the full names.

   -------------------
   -- Writing files --
   -------------------
   --  Writing is more complex than reading, since generally the whole buffer
   --  to write down is not available immediately, but the user wants to be
   --  able to write characters in a series of calls.
   --  The interface in this package will also support remote files. In this
   --  case, writing the small chunks is done in a temporary file, which is
   --  sent to the remote host only when the file is closed.

   type Writable_File is private;

   Invalid_File : constant Writable_File;
   --  Used when a file couldn't be open.

   function Write_File (File : Virtual_File) return Writable_File;
   --  Open File for writing. The returned handler can be used for writting.
   --  You must close it, otherwise the file will not actually be written in
   --  some cases
   --  Return Invalid_File is the file couldn't be open for writing

   procedure Write
     (File    : in out Writable_File;
      Str     : UTF8_String;
      As_UTF8 : Boolean := True);
   --  Write a string to File. The required encoding for the string depends
   --  on As_UTF8.

   procedure Close (File : in out Writable_File);
   --  Closes File, and write the file to disk

   ---------------------
   -- Locale encoding --
   ---------------------
   --  The following functions return their result encoded in the locale
   --  charset, suitable for calls to the C library and low-level manipulations
   --  of files.

   function Locale_Full_Name (File : Virtual_File) return String;
   --  Same as Full_Name

   function Locale_Base_Name (File : Virtual_File) return String;
   --  Same as Base_Name

   -------------
   -- Gvalues --
   -------------
   --  The following subprograms are provided to encapsulate a virtual file
   --  in a GValue.

   procedure Set_File (Value : in out Glib.Values.GValue; File : Virtual_File);
   --  Store File into Value

   function Get_File (Value : Glib.Values.GValue) return Virtual_File;
   --  Retrieve the file stored in Value

   function Get_Virtual_File_Type return Glib.GType;
   --  Return the gtype to use for virtual files

private
   --  This type is implemented as a controlled type, to ease the memory
   --  management (so that we can have gtk+ callbacks that take a Virtual
   --  File in argument, without caring who has to free the memory).
   --  Other solutions (using Name_Id to store the strings for instance) do
   --  not work properly, since the functions above cannot modify File
   --  itself, although they do compute some information lazily).

   type Contents_Record is record
      Connection      : Remote_Connections.Remote_Connection;
      Ref_Count       : Natural := 1;

   type Writable_File is record
      File     : Virtual_File;
