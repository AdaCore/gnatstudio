   type Command_Type is (Internal, Hidden, Visible, User);
   --  Internal commands are not stored into the command history. No output
   --  will be visible to the user.
   --  This is used for all the commands needed internally by gvd to update
   --  its windows, or for commands that are needed internally for higher
   --  level commands. These will not be saved in the session file.
   --
   --  Hidden commands are stored into the history but not shown in
   --  the debugger window. Their output is also not visible to the user.
   --
   --  Visible commands are shown into the command history and displayed in
   --  the debugger window, as well as their output. This is typically the
   --  mode to be used for menu items or toolbar buttons.
   --
   --  User is used for commands that have been typed manually by the user
   --  in the command window. These commands are inserted into the history,
   --  their output is visible in the command window, but the command itself
   --  is not printed
