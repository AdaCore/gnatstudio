--  This package contains target specific parameters that are set at configure
--  time.

package GVD is
   pragma Pure;

   ---------------
   -- Constants --
   ---------------

   Version : constant String := "@GVD_VERSION@";
   --  Version number of this software.

   Target  : constant String := "@TARGET@";
   --  Target for which GVD is built.

   Prefix : constant String := "@prefix@";
   --  Default prefix used e.g for finding support files like po files.
   --  Note that this prefix can be overriden by using the GVD_ROOT
   --  environment variable.

   Max_Frame : constant := 500;
   --  Maximum number of frames displayed in the backtrace window.

   Max_Column_Width : constant := 200;
   --  Maximum width (in pixels) for a column in a list.

   Default_Link_Font_Size : constant := @LINK_SIZE@;
   --  Default font size used in Preferences for links.

   Default_Font_Size : constant := @FONT_SIZE@;
   --  Default font size used in Preferences for text.

   Color_Selection : constant String := "@COLOR_SELECTION@";
   --  Color used to select items in the data window.

   Need_To_Strip_CR : constant Boolean := @STRIP_CR@;
   --  True on systems where lines are separated by both LF and CR.

   Use_Ptys : constant Boolean := @USE_PTYS@;
   --  True if we should connect to the debugger through pseudo-terminals
   --  (at least on Unix machines). False if we should use pipes.
   --  Although the latter is more portable, and should be used for machines
   --  that don't support ptys, we recommend using the former since this
   --  provides a better support for remote debuggers and the "interrupt"
   --  button, among other things.

   Async_Commands : constant Boolean := @ASYNC_COMMANDS@;
   --  True if user commands are handled asynchronousely, to avoid recursion
   --  in the event processing. See design/commands.txt for more details.
   --  This variable is useful for debugging, and also for systems that do
   --  not fully support the Gdk_Input package (e.g Windows).

   Can_Output : constant Boolean := @CAN_OUTPUT@;
   --  True if gvd can print text on standard output/error, false if gvd
   --  is a GUI only process (e.g under windows).

   Layout_Width : constant := 20;
   --  Width for the area reserved for the buttons in the source/asm editor.

end GVD;
