--  This package implements a text area target for the display of source
--  code.
--  It knows how to highlight keywords, strings and commands, and how
--  to display icons at the beginning of each line where a given function
--  returns True.
--  It also provides a source explorer that can quickly display and jump
--  in the various entities in the file (e.g procedures, types, ...).
--
--  Caches
--  =======
--
--  Some data is expensive to recompute for each file (e.g the list of lines
--  that contain code). We have thus implemented a system of caches so that
--  we don't need to recompute this data every time the file is reloaded.
--  This information is also computed in a lazy fashion, ie while nothing
--  else is happening in the application.
