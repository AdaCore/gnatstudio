Building GVD 
============

Prerequisites:
- GNAT 3.13 or higher
- GtkAda 1.2.9

To build GVD, you first need to install GNAT and GtkAda, then
do the following:
   $ ./configure
   $ make

This will create an executable called 'gvd' in the gvd subdirectory that you
can then copy on your PATH (e.g /usr/bin).
