--  This is the root package of the MI API.  This API provides tools to
--  interact with GDB through its MI (Machine Interface) mode, instead of using
--  the CLI (Command Line Interface) mode.  This MI mode has been specialy
--  designed for IDEs and their communication with GDB.  This protocol is
--  text-based, and provides a nice output for program (read "provides an
--  easy-to-parse output").  The MI output grammar is well defined and
--  described in the MI.Ast.Parser package.
--
--  Among other things, this API provides both lexer and parser to manipulate
--  the RAW output of GDB's MI mode and build an AST-like structure.  Several
--  visitors tagged type are also provided for common walk and manipulation of
--  this AST.  Specific visitors for dedicated tasks can be implemented just by
--  extending the base type (i.e. implementing the MI.Ast.Visitors.Visitor
--  interface).
