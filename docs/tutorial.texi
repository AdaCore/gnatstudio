@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
This document provides a guide through the major capabilities
of the GNAT Programming System by working on a code example: sdc, a simple
desktop calculator.

It is important to realize that the features that you are about to
experiment with are available on multiple platforms, using the same user
interface and capabilities, providing a user-friendly environment
with a tight integration between the tools.

Start GPS in the directory containing the tutorial files, or if the directory
is read-only, copy the @file{tutorial} directory and its subdirectories in a
local (writable) area, and start GPS from the @file{tutorial} directory, so
that GPS will load the right context.

By default, the tutorial sources can be found under
@code{<prefix>/doc/gps/examples/tutorial}, where @code{<prefix>} is the
prefix directory of the GPS installation.

Alternatively, if you have already started GPS in another directory, you
can load the project @code{sdc.gpr} by using the menu @code{Project->Open...}

If you are reading this document from GPS itself, we recommend that you
select the window displaying this document by clicking on it: the title
bar should be displayed in @i{blue}; then select the menu item
@code{Window->Floating}: this will move the @i{Help} window outside GPS
itself, allowing you to easily read this document while following the
tutorial steps in the main window of GPS.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Quick overview of the GPS areas
@chapter Quick overview of the GPS areas
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent

Having launched GPS, you should now have access to a main window composed of
several areas:

@itemize @bullet
@item a menu bar at the top
@item a tool bar under the menu bar
@item a project explorer under the tool bar, on the left side
@item a working area on the right of the project explorer
@item a messages window under the working area
@item a status bar at the bottom left
@item a progress bar at the bottom right
@end itemize

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Editing sources
@chapter Editing sources
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent

In the project explorer, open the @code{common} directory by clicking
on the @code{[+]} sign on the left of @code{common}.
This will open the directory and display a list of source files located
in this directory.

Now, double click on @file{sdc.adb}: this will open a source editor on this
file. The source code is syntax-highlighted: keywords, comments, strings and
characters have different colors.

As with many other properties, colors are configurable in GPS:

Select the menu @code{Edit->Preferences}. This will open a preferences
dialog window.

Select the @code{Editor} page by clicking on the tab named @code{Editor}.
Similarly, select the @code{Fonts & Colors} page.

As you go over the various lines and labels, you will notice that by
holding the mouse over a label, a tooltip pops up displaying on-line help
about the selected item.

Change the @code{Keyword color} by clicking on the down arrow on the right
of the @code{Keyword color} line.

Choose a color, e.g a light green. When you're done with the color
selection, simply click again on the arrow, or anywhere outside the
color selection area.

Click on the @code{Apply} button and look at the effects in the source
editor. If you like the new display, click on @code{OK} to confirm the
changes, otherwise clicking on @code{Cancel} will revert to the previous
(black) color.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Building applications
@chapter Building applications
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent

Select the menu @code{Build->Make->sdc.adb}: this will launch a complete
build of the @i{sdc} application. Note also that a key binding
is associated with this menu item (@key{F4}).

The build has generated a number of errors in a new window: the @i{Locations}
tree, displayed in the bottom area.

Click on the first error message (@i{sdc.adb, 28:6  : (style) bad indentation})
to jump to the @file{sdc.adb} source editor,
at the line (28) and column (06) of the error.

Fix the error by hand by inserting a space.

Now you can fix the next error by moving the cursor to the line 30 (press
the @key{down} arrow twice), and by using @key{Ctrl-Tab} (press first the
@key{Control} key, and then the @key{Tab} key on your keyboard): this key
combination asks the source editor to automatically re-indent the current
line.

Note that on some window managers or desktop environments,
@key{Ctrl-Tab} is already defined. If this is the case, you can change this
shortcut from the preferences dialog (menu @code{Edit->Preferences},
@code{Editor} tab).

You can then fix all the remaining errors by selecting the whole block
(from line 28 to line 40) and pressing @key{Ctrl-Tab}. To select a block,
you can either click on the left mouse button and select the area while
holding the button, or using the keyboard by pressing the @key{Shift} key
and moving the cursor using the @key{Up} or @key{Down} keys.

Press the @key{F4} key to build again. You will be asked to save the file
@file{sdc.adb} before the build starts. Confirm by clicking on @code{Yes}.
If you look at the progress bar, you will see that while the build is in
progress the state of the compilation is displayed, giving you
the current number of files compiled, and the number of remaining files.

This should now report a successful build.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Source Navigation
@chapter Source Navigation
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent

Now let's try to understand a little bit about how the program is working by
looking at the @file{sdc.adb} editor: there's a loop, the main processing is
done by the functions Process and Next (at line 30).

Click around line 30, move the mouse over @code{Process} and let a tooltip
appear (@code{global procedure tokens.process declared at tokens.ads:19}): this
gives information about the kind of entity and the location (file and line) of
the declaration of this procedure.

Do the same for @code{Next} (@code{global procedure tokens.next declared at
tokens.ads:15}).

Keeping the mouse over @code{Next}, display the contextual menu by clicking on
the right mouse button,
then click on @code{Goto declaration of Next}: we're now in the package
@code{Tokens}, in file @file{tokens.ads}; but where is this file in the project?

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Search Dialog
@chapter Search Dialog
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent

Select the menu @code{Navigate->Find/Replace...}: this will open a search
dialog.
In the @code{Search for:} text entry type @file{tokens.ads}. Then
select @code{Project explorer} in the @code{Look in:} area. The search
area provides an easy way to search for text or regular expressions in
several contexts including the current file, the project explorer, the help
window, ...

Now click on @code{Find}. The file @file{tokens.ads}, in directory @code{struct}
is highlighted.

Close the search dialog by clicking on the @code{Close} button.

Note that in this specific case, a simpler way to locate a file in the
explorer is to use the contextual menu from the source editor:
@code{Locate in explorer: tokens.ads}.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Project Explorer (entities)
@chapter Project Explorer (entities)
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
Click on the @code{[+]} sign to open @file{tokens.ads} entities.
When you click on a file in the explorer, you get
language sensitive information about the file, such as
@code{packages}, @code{subprograms}, @code{tasks}, ... for @code{Ada}.

Open the @code{subprogram} category, click on @code{Process}: this
will open @file{tokens.ads} and move the cursor on the first line
corresponding to the procedure @code{Process}.

Similarly, click on @code{Next}, and move your mouse on @code{Next}
in the source editor.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Back to Source Navigation
@chapter Back to Source Navigation
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent

Using the contextual menu, select @code{Goto body of Next};
scroll through the procedure @code{Next}, move the mouse on
@code{Instructions.Read} at line 46 and from the contextual menu, select
@code{Goto body of Read}.

We've now navigated quite a bit through the application source code,
which you can verify by clicking on the left arrow in the toolbar, to go
back to the previous locations visited.

Repeat the operation until you're back in @file{sdc.adb}.
As for the undo/redo capability in the source editor, the
@code{goto previous/next location} is infinite.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Run
@chapter Run
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
It is now time to run the application: select the menu
@code{Build->Run->sdc}, which will open a dialog window.
Type @code{../input.txt} in the text entry: this is the name of a text
file that will be passed as argument to the @i{sdc} program.

Now click on @code{OK}: a new window titled @code{Run: sdc ../input.txt}
is created at the bottom of the main window where the sdc application
runs and displays an unexpected internal error: this is a good opportunity
to use the integrated debugger.

Close the execution window by clicking on the x icon on the top right
corner of this window.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Debug
@chapter Debug
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent

Open the preferences dialog (menu @code{Edit->Preferences}) and
click on the @code{Debugger} tab on the left; set the button
@code{Break on exceptions} to @i{True}: this will enable by default a special
breakpoint every time an exception is raised. Click on @code{OK} to confirm your
change.

Now select the menu @code{Debug->Initialize->sdc}: two new windows are
created, a data window and a debugger console.
You can also look at the various debug menu item and toolbar buttons which are
now activated.

Use the menu @code{Debug->Data->Call Stack}: this opens a new window on the
right of the source editors. If you select the contextual menu in the call
stack, various pieces of information can be displayed or
removed in the call stack. From this contextual menu, add the
@code{Frame Number} info by clicking on it.

Now select the menu @code{Debug->Run...}. Notice that @code{../input.txt} has
been filled automatically for you since the two menus @code{Build->Run...} and
@code{Debug->Run...} are synchronized. Click on @code{OK}: the debugger should
stop on an exception (@code{Contraint_Error} in the file @file{stack.adb}, at
line 49).

Go up in the call stack by clicking on the @code{tokens.process} line
(frame number 6).

If you move the mouse over the parameter @code{T} at line 64, a tooltip is
displayed showing the value of @code{T}. You have probably noticed that
tooltips, like menus, are contextual: depending on the current session and
on the entity selected, different information is displayed.

Select the contextual menu @code{Debug->Display T}: this displays in the data
window a box containing the different fields of @code{T}, each clearly
separated.

On @code{T} data display, select the contextual menu
@code{Show Value + Type}: this displays for all fields both their type and
value.

Special colors are used in the data display: blue for pointers that can be
dereferenced by a double-click (double click on @code{T.val}); red for fields
that have been modified since last step.

In the contextual menu that pops up when you hold the mouse over @code{T}.
select @code{View memory at &T}: a memory view is opened.
Use the @code{up} and @code{down} arrows on the right to visit memory.

Click in the memory dump, and modify it by typing numbers. Notice the
red color for modified values;
click on @code{Undo Changes} to cancel the modifications;
click on @code{Close} to close the memory window.

In the call stack, go back to @code{stack.push} frame (num 4).
Move the mouse over @code{Last} and let the debugger display its value: 0.
From the contextual menu, select @code{Goto declaration of Last}: this
will jump to the line 16 of @file{stack.adb}, where you can see that
@code{Last} is a @code{Natural}. Now click on the @code{Goto Previous Location}
button in the toolbar: we're now back at line 49 where we can see that for a
@code{Push} procedure, @code{Last} should be incremented, and not decremented.

Fix the line to @code{Last := Last + 1;}

Save the file (@key{Ctrl-S});
End the debug session: menu @code{Debug->Terminate};
Rebuild (press @key{F4} key);
Rerun (menu @code{Build->Run->sdc}): the program now completes as expected.
Close the execution window.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Call Graph
@chapter Call Graph
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
Now go back to the file @file{sdc.adb}, move the mouse over the procedure
@i{sdc} at line 8, select the contextual menu
@code{References->Sdc calls...}: this will open a new window titled
@i{Call graph browser}.

Click on the right arrow of @code{Process} (one of the first items on
the right). Also click on the right arrow of @code{error_msg}.

Select @code{Orthogonal links} in the contextual menu of the graph to change the
way links are displayed in the graph.
Click on the canvas, then play with the zoom (@key{=} and @key{-} keys).

If you select @code{Hide links} from @code{error_msg} contextual menu, this
will hide all the links that are related to this item: the link between the
callers and callees of @code{error_msg} are no longer displayed. This can
be useful when the graph becomes complex, to hide some parts. If you go back to
the contextual menu, you can now select @code{Show links} to show the links
again.

Click on right arrow of @code{process} (@file{instructions.ads:12},
the item at the top right of the graph).

The items can also be moved: move e.g @code{msg} item around.

Click on left arrow of @code{msg}
to display who is calling @code{msg}. Notice that @code{view} (on the left
of the graph) calls @code{msg}.

Click on left arrow of @code{view}: the arrow disappears, and no
new items are created, which means that @code{view} isn't called by anyone,
so we're now going to remove this procedure.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Locations Tree
@chapter Locations Tree
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
From @i{view}, select the contextual menu @code{Go to spec};
then from the source editor (file @file{stack.ads}), select the contextual
menu @code{References->Find all references to View}: this highlights the
@code{Locations} tree which now contains all the references for @code{view},
ordered by files (@file{stack.ads} and @file{stack.adb}).

The first location is highlited automatically: this is the spec of the
procedure @code{View}. Now click in the tree on @file{stack.adb}: two locations
are listed, at line 90 and 97. Click on each of these locations: they correspond
to the procedure body.

The @code{Find all references} capability is another way to list all the uses of
an entity, and it confirms that @code{View} isn't called in our project.

Remove @i{View} body by e.g selecting it, and pressing the @key{Delete} key,
then save the file (@key{Ctrl-S}).

Do the same for the spec, save the file.

Close the @file{stack.ads} and @file{stack.adb} files (menu File->Close,
or using the shortcut @key{Ctrl-W}), as well as the call graph window.
Rebuild by pressing the @key{F4} key.

@c "Let's now have a look at all the changes we've done so far, by looking at
@c  the version control system explorer, aka VCS explorer"

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@c @node Version Control
@c @chapter Version Control
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@c @noindent
@c From the project explorer, contextual menu on project @i{sdc}, select
@c @code{Version Control->Query status for project}. The VCS Explorer is
@c opened, listing the files in the project.
@c => Explain the use of icons for status, log files, ...
@c => The list can be sorted by status or by file name, by clicking
@c on the @code{Status} and @code{File name} labels.

@c Move the mouse over @file{stack.ads}, select the contextual menu
@c @code{Compare against head revision}:
@c this will open a visual comparison between the version in the repository,
@c and the local (modified) file; You can see that scrolling is synchronized
@c between the two files, and that colors are used to show lines
@c added, removed and modified.

@c Close the Visual Comparison window

@c Go back to the VCS Explorer

@c On @file{stack.ads}, contextual menu, @code{Edit changelog}

@c In the change log, type a log, e.g: @code{(View): Removed, since unused}

@c Save and close the log editor.
@c This log file will now associated with @file{stack.ads} until the
@c next check in.

@c Go back to the VCS Explorer, @file{stack.ads} has now an icon
@c showing that a log is associated with this file.

@c On @file{stack.ads}, commit the file using the contextual menu,
@c entry @code{Commit}.

Let's now see how to create a project corresponding to the @i{sdc}
project we've used in this tutorial.

@node Project Wizard
@section Project Wizard
@noindent

@b{WARNING}: while in the project wizard, you will not be able to scroll
through the tutorial if you are reading it within GPS. You may want to resize
the window now so that the entire section on the wizard is visible, or reopen
the tutorial in another browser.

Go to the menu @code{Project->New...}: this is a standard wizard, with various
steps listed on the left area of the window.

Type @i{sdc2} in the project name field.
It is possible to create a multi-language project by selecting the C or C++
check box.

Click on @code{Forward}: we are now on the @code{VCS page}. @i{VCS} stands
for @i{Version Control System}.
GPS has a generic support for @i{VCS} which allows it to easily support
new systems. Currently GPS supports CVS and ClearCase. Select @code{CVS}.

Click on @code{Forward}: this is the source directories selection,
used to specify the project's sources. Open @file{tutorial}, click on @code{common},
and add it by clicking on the left arrow.

Select the @file{tutorial} directory in the bottom area, and remove it by
clicking on the right arrow. As for common, add @code{struct} directory.

Click on @code{Forward}: this is the @code{Build} and @code{Exec} directory
selection, used to store object, ali files, ...

Click on @code{Browse}, open @file{tutorial}, click on @code{obj}, click on
@code{OK}.

Click on @code{Forward}: this is the naming scheme editor.
GNAT is very flexible and can use any kind of naming scheme for Ada files.
In particular, you can easily set the default file
extensions (e.g by using one of the predefined schemes) and you
can also specify exceptions that use non standard file names.

Click on @code{Forward}: this is the main units selection, used mainly for
building executables and debugging.

Click on @code{Add}, select the @code{common} directory on the left, click on
@code{sdc.adb} on the right, click on @code{OK}.

Click on @code{Forward}: we're now in the switch selector.
Select @code{Recompile if switches changed}, @code{Debug information}.

Click on @code{Ada} page.

Select @code{Full errors} and @code{Overflow checking}.
The boxes and the command line (the text entry at the
bottom of the page) are fully synchronized, e.g if you click on the
command line, and change @code{-gnatf} to @code{-gnat}, the
@code{Full errors} check box is unselected; now type @code{a} to get
@code{-gnata}, and notice that @code{Enable assertions} is now selected.

Click on @code{Forward}: voila, we've created a project similar to the one
used in this tutorial.

Click on @code{Cancel} to close the wizard.

@node Project properties
@section Project properties
@noindent

In the project explorer, on the project @i{sdc}, use the contextual menu
@code{Edit project properties}.
All the properties set in the project wizard can be found here as well.
You can also switch between pages by clicking on the tabs.

Once you're done exploring the property pages, click on the @code{Cancel}
button to close the properties window.

@node Variable editor
@section Variable editor
@noindent

You have probably noticed the @code{Build} label located on top of the
project explorer. This is a configuration variable. With GPS and the GNAT
project facility, you can define as many configuration variables as you want,
and modify any project settings (e.g switches, sources, ...) based on the
values of configuration variables. These variables can also take any
number of different values.

The @code{Build} variable shows a typical @code{Debug/Production} configuration
where we've set different switches for the two modes.

Click on the button at the left (@code{Edit variable properties}): this
is the variable editor, where values can be added or renamed.
Close the variable editor by clicking on the @code{Cancel} button.

Now, let's take a look at the switches set in the project.

@node Switch editor
@section Switch editor
@noindent

Click on the @code{sdc} project in the project explorer, then
select the menu item @code{Project->Edit switches}: a global
switch editor is displayed in the working area.
This editor lists the switches associated with each file and
the gray area shows the default (global) switches; you will also notice
that @file{screen_output.adb} has specific switches, which are highlighted
using a different font.

Switch between @code{Debug} and @code{Production} mode in the @code{Build}
combo box: the switches are updated at the same time.

Back to our project, let's now examine the dependencies between sources.

@node Source dependencies
@section Source dependencies
@noindent

Select @file{sdc.adb} in the explorer and then the contextual menu item
@code{Examine dependencies for sdc.adb}: this will open a new graph showing
the dependencies between sources of the project.

Click on the right arrow of @file{tokens.ads} to display the files that
@file{tokens.ads} depends on. Similarly, click on the right arrow of
@file{stack.ads}.

@node Project dependencies
@section Project dependencies
@noindent

On the @i{sdc} project, select the contextual menu
@code{Add dependency->From project file...}, then open the @i{tutorial}
directory and click on the @code{projects} subdirectory. Select the file
@code{prj1.gpr}.

You can see the new dependencies added in the project explorer, as a tree of
projects. In particular, project dependencies are duplicated: if you open
the @code{prj1} icon by clicking on the @code{[+]} sign, and then
similarly open the @code{prj2} icon, you will notice that the project
@code{prj4} is displayed twice: once as a dependency of @code{prj2}, and
once as a dependency of @code{prj1}.

GPS can also display the graph of dependencies between projects: on @i{sdc}
project, use the contextual menu
@code{Examine project hierarchy for sdc}: this will open a project hierarchy
browser.

In the browser, you can move the project items, and select them to highlight
the dependencies.

Close the project browser by clicking on the @code{[x]} sign at the top right
area of the window, or by typing @key{Ctrl-W}, or by using the menu
@code{File->Close}.

On @i{prj1} project, select the contextual menu
@code{Remove dependency sdc -> prj1} to remove the dependency added between
@i{sdc} and @i{prj1}.
