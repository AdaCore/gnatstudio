Welcome to GNAT Studio
**************************************

GNAT Studio is a complete integrated development environment.  It integrates
with a wide range of tools, providing easy access to each. It integrates
especially well with AdaCore's tools but can easily be extended to work
with other tools by writing small plugins in Python.

Here is a summary of the features of GNAT Studio:

* :ref:`Multiple_Document_Interface`

  GNAT Studio uses a multiple document interface, allowing you to organize
  windows the way you want and organize your desktop by floating them to other
  screens or dragging them to any location.  (GNAT Studio restores the desktop
  the next time it is restarted.)

* Built-in editor (:ref:`Editing_Files`)

  Fully customizable editor with syntax highlighting, smart completion of text,
  multiple views of the same file, automatic indentation, block-level
  navigation, support for Emacs key bindings, code folding, refactoring, visual
  comparison of files, and alias expansion, among other features.

* Support for compile/build/run cycle (:ref:`Compilation/Build`)

  Any compiler called by a command line can be integrated in GNAT Studio, with
  built in support for GNAT, :program:`gcc`, and :program:`make`.  You can
  easily navigate through error messages, and automatic code fixing is
  provided for many common errors.  GNAT Studio includes support for
  cross-compilers (running compilers on a different machine than the one on
  which GNAT Studio is running).

* Project management (:ref:`Project_Handling`)

  You can use project files (editable either graphically or manually) to
  describe attributes of a project, including the location of sources,
  their naming schemes, and how they should be built.  GNAT Studio provides a
  graphical browser to analyze both dependencies between your projects and
  between sources within your projects.

* Integration with various :ref:`Version_Control_System`

  CVS, subversion, :program:`git`, and ClearCase are supported out of the
  box.  You can add support for others by customizing some XML plugins.

* Intelligent :ref:`Source_Navigation`

  By leveraging information provided by the compilers and using its own
  parsers, GNAT Studio allows you to find program information such as the
  declaration of entities and their references, that would otherwise be
  hard to locate.  It also provides advanced capabilities such as call
  trees and UML-like browsers to explore package dependencies.

* Full debugger integration (:ref:`Debugging`)

  GNAT Studio fully integrates with :program:`gdb` and provides multiple
  graphical views to monitor the state of your application, including a call
  stack, a visual display for the values of the variables, and a breakpoint
  editor.

* Integration with code analysis tools (:ref:`Tools`)

  GNAT Studio integrates tightly with various command-line tools such as
  GNATcoverage (for the coverage of your code) and GNAT SAS and Spark
  (to analyze your code). In most cases, it provides graphical rendering
  of their output, often integrated with the editor itself so the information
  is available where and when you need it.

* Fully customizable (:ref:`Customizing_and_Extending_GNAT_Studio`)

  GNAT Studio provides an extensive Python API, allowing you to customize
  existing features or easily develop your own new plugins.  Simpler
  customization can be done through the numerous preferences and local
  settings.
