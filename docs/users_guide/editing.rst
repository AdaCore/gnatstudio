General Information
===================

Source editing is one of the central parts of GPS.  It allows access to
many other functionalities, including extended source navigation and source
analysis tools.  You can have as many editor windows as you need.  Each
editor window receives annotations from other components in GPS, such as a
debugger.

We use the term "pointer" to refer to the mouse pointer and "cursor" to
refer to the text cursor.

.. image:: source-editor.png

The source editor provides an extensive set of features, including:

*Title bar*

  Displays the full name of the file including path information in the
  title bar of the editor window.

*Line number information*

  Located to the left of the source editor, :index:`Line numbers <single:
  preferences; editor --> display line numbers>` can be disabled using the
  :menuselection:`Editor --> Display line numbers` preference.  This area
  also displays additional information in some cases, such as the current
  line of execution when debugging or VCS annotations.

*Scrollbar*

  Located to the right of the editor, this allows scrolling through the
  source file.  The highlighted area of the scrollbar corresponds to the
  visible portion of the file.  While you are scrolling, the editor
  displays a tooltip showing the file, line number, and subprogram
  corresponding to the center of the visible portion.

*Speed column*

  This :index:`column <single: preferences; editor --> speed column
  policy>`, when visible, is located on the left of the editor. It allows
  you to view all the highlighted lines in a file at a glance. For example,
  all the lines containing compilation errors are displayed in the
  :guilabel:`Speed Column`. Use the :menuselection:`Editor --> Speed column
  policy` preference to control the display of this area. It can sometimes
  be convenient to keep it visible at all times (to avoid resizing the
  editors when new information becomes available) or to hide it
  automatically when not needed to save space on the screen.

*Status bar*

  Gives information about the file. It is divided in two sections, one each
  on the left and right of the window.

  - The left part of the status bar shows the current :index:`subprogram
    <single: preferences; editor --> display subprogram names>` name for
    languages that support this capability. Currently Ada, C, and C++
    have this ability. The :menuselection:`Editor --> Display subprogram
    names` preference controls this display.


  - The right section contains multiple items:

    * The box displays the position of the cursor in the file as a line and
      column number. When you have made a selection in the editor, this area
      also displays the size of the selection (number of lines and
      characters).

    * Next to the box is an icon showing whether the file is writable or
      readonly.  Change this state by clicking on the icon, which toggles
      between :guilabel:`Writable` and :guilabel:`Read Only`.  This does not
      change the permissions of the file on disk: it only changes the
      writability of the view in the source editor.

      When you try to save a readonly file, GPS asks for confirmation, and
      if possible, saves the file, keeping its readonly state.

    * If the file is maintained under version control and version control
      is supported and enabled in GPS, the next icon shows VCS information
      for the file: the VCS kind (e.g. CVS or subversion) followed by the
      revision number and, if available, the file's status.

*Contextual menu*

  Displayed when you right-click on any area of the source editor.  See in
  particular :ref:`Contextual_Menus_for_Source_Navigation` for more details.

*Syntax highlighting*

  Based on the programming language associated with the file, reserved
  words and languages constructs such as comments and strings are
  highlighted in different colors and fonts.

  By default, GPS knows about many languages. You can also easily add
  support for other languages through plug-ins. Most languages supported by
  GPS provide syntax highlighting in the editor.

*Automatic indentation*

  When enabled, lines are automatically :index:`indented <indentation>`
  each time you press the :kbd:`Enter` key or the indentation key, which,
  by default, is :kbd:`Tab`.  Change it in the key manager dialog.  See
  :ref:`The_Key_Shortcuts_Editor`.

  If you have selected a list of lines when you press the indentation key,
  GPS indents all the lines.

*Tooltips*

  When you place the pointer over a word in the source editor, GPS displays
  a small :index:`window <tooltip>` if there is relevant contextual
  information to display about that word.  The type of information
  displayed depends on the current state of GPS.

  In normal mode, the editor displays the entity kind and location of the
  declaration when this information is available, i.e., when the
  cross-reference information about the current file has been generated. If
  there is no relevant information, no tooltip is displayed.  See
  :ref:`Support_for_Cross-References` for more information.

  .. highlight:: ada

  In addition, the editor displays documentation for the entity, if
  available.  This is the block of comments immediately before or after the
  entity's declaration (without any intervening blank lines). For example,
  the editor displays the following documentation for Ada::

    --  A comment for A
    A : Integer;

    B : Integer;
    --  A comment for B

    C : Integer;

    --  Not a comment for C, there is a blank line

  When comments appear both before and after the entity, GPS choses the one
  given by the :index:`preference <preferences; documentation --> leading
  documentation>` :menuselection:`Documentation --> Leading documentation`.
  In debugging mode, the editor shows the value of the variable under the
  pointer if the variable is known to the debugger.

  Disable the automatic pop up of tool tips via the :index:`preference
  <preferences; editor --> tooltips>` :menuselection:`Editor --> Tooltips`.

*Code completion*

  GPS provides two kinds of code :index:`completion`: a :ref:`smart code
  completion <Smart_Completion>`, based on semantic information, and a text
  completion.

  Text completion is useful when editing a file using the same words
  repeatedly where it provides automatic word completion.  When you type
  the :kbd:`Ctrl-/` key combination (customizable through the key manager
  dialog) after a partial word, GPS inserts the next potential completion.
  Typing this key again cycles through the list of potential completions.
  GPS searches for text completions in all currently open files.

*Delimiter highlighting*

  When the cursor is placed before an opening :index:`delimiter` or after a
  closing delimiter, GPS highlights both delimiters.  The following
  characters are considered delimiters: ()[]{}.  Disable highlighting of
  delimiters with the :index:`preference <preferences;editor --> highlight
  delimiters>` :menuselection:`Editor --> Highlight delimiters`.

  Jump to a corresponding delimiter by invoking the :menuselection:`jump to
  matching delimiter` action (which can be bound to a key in the key
  shortcuts editor).  Invoking this action a second time returns the cursor
  to its original position.

*Current line highlighting*

  Configure the editor to highlight the :index:`current line` with a
  specified color (see the :index:`preference <preferences; editor -->
  fonts & colors --> current line color>` :menuselection:`Editor --> Fonts
  & Colors --> Current line color`).

*Current block highlighting*

  If the :index:`preference <preferences;editor --> block highlighting>`
  :menuselection:`Editor --> Block highlighting` is enabled, GPS highlights
  the current block of code, e.g. the current :command:`begin...end` block
  or loop statement, by placing a vertical bar to its left.

  Block highlighting also takes into account the changes made in your
  source code and is recomputed to determine the current block when needed.
  This capability is currently implemented for the Ada, C, and C++
  languages.

*Block folding*

  When the :index:`preference <preferences;editor --> block folding>`
  :menuselection:`Editor --> Block folding` is enabled, GPS displays
  :samp:`-` icons on the left side corresponding to the beginning of each
  block. If you click on one of these icons, all lines corresponding to
  this block are hidden except the first.  Like block highlighting, these
  icons are recomputed automatically when you modify your sources.

  This capability is currently implemented for Ada, C, and C++ languages.

*Auto save*

  Configure the editor to periodically save modified files.  See
  :ref:`Autosave delay <autosave_delay>` for a full description of this
  capability.

*Automatic highlighting of entities*

  When the pointer is positioned on an entity in the source editor, GPS
  will highlight all references to this entity in the current editor.  When
  the pointer is moved away from the entity, the highlighting is removed.

  .. index:: plug-ins; auto_highlight_occurrences.py

  This is controlled by the plugin :file:`auto_highlight_occurrences.py`:
  it can be deactivated by disabling the plugin (see
  :ref:`The_Plug-ins_Editor`).

  Details such as the presence of indications in the :guilabel:`Speed Column` or
  highlighting color can be customized in the :guilabel:`Plugins` section
  of :ref:`The_Preferences_Dialog`.

.. index:: emacs

GPS also integrates with existing third party editors such as
:program:`emacs` or :program:`vi`.  See :ref:`Using_an_External_Editor`.

Key bindings
------------

In addition to the standard keys used to navigate in the editor (up, down,
right, left, page up, page down), the integrated editor provides a number of
key bindings allowing easy navigation in the file.

There are also several ways to define new key bindings, see
:ref:`Defining_text_aliases` and :ref:`Binding_actions_to_keys`.

.. index:: hexadecimal
.. index:: ASCII

.. _Menu_Items:

Menu Items
==========

This section describes the main menus that give access to extended
functionality related to source editing.

.. _The_File_Menu:

The :menuselection:`File` Menu
------------------------------

.. index:: menu; file --> new

* :menuselection:`File --> New`

  Open a new untitled source editor.  No syntax highlighting is performed until
  the file is saved since GPS needs to know the file name in order to choose
  the programming language associated with a file.

  When you save a new file for the first time, GPS asks you to enter the
  name of the file. If you have started typing Ada code, GPS tries to guess a
  name for the new file based on the first main entity in the editor and
  the current naming scheme.

.. index:: menu; file --> new view

* :menuselection:`File --> New View`

  Create a new view of the current editor. The new view shares the same
  contents: if you modify one of the source views, the other view is
  updated at the same time. This is particularly useful when you want to
  display two different parts of the same file, for example a function spec
  and its body.

  You can also create a new view by holding the :kbd:`shift` key down while
  dropping the editor (see :ref:`Moving_Windows`). This second method is
  better because you can specify where you want to put the new view. The
  default when using the menu puts the new view on top of the current
  editor.

.. index:: menu; file --> open

* :menuselection:`File --> Open...`

  Open a file selection dialog where you can select a file to edit. On
  Windows, this is the standard file selector. On other platforms, this is a
  built-in file selector described in :ref:`The_File_Selector`.

.. index:: menu; file --> open from project
.. _open_from_project:

* :menuselection:`File --> Open From Project...`

  Move the focus to the :ref:`omni_search` field, where you can immediately
  start typing part of the file name you want to open. This is the fastest
  way to select files to open.

.. index:: menu; file --> open from host
.. _Open_From_Host:

* :menuselection:`File --> Open From Host...`

  Open a file selector dialog where you can specify a remote host, as
  defined in :ref:`The_remote_configuration_dialog`. If you have access to
  a remote host file system, you can specify a file which can be edited in
  GPS. When you press the :guilabel:`save` button or menu item, the file is
  saved on the remote host.

  See :ref:`Using_GPS_for_Remote_Development` for a more efficient way to
  work locally on remote files.

.. index:: menu; file --> recent

* :menuselection:`File --> Recent`

  Open a submenu containing a list of the ten most recent files opened
  in GPS.

.. index:: menu; file --> save

* :menuselection:`File --> Save`

  Save the file corresponding to current source editor, if there are changes.

.. index:: menu; file --> save as

* :menuselection:`File --> Save As...`

  Save the current file under a different name, using the file selector
  dialog.  See :ref:`The_File_Selector`.

.. index:: menu; file --> save more

* :menuselection:`File --> Save More`

  Give access to additional save capabilities:

  - :menuselection:`File --> Save More --> All`

     Save all items, including projects.

  - :menuselection:`File --> Save More -->Desktop`

     Save the desktop to a file. The desktop includes information about
     files and graphs and their window sizes and positions in GPS. One
     desktop is saved per top level project so that when you reload the
     same project you get back to the same state you were in when you
     left GPS. If you load a different project, either another desktop or
     the default desktop is loaded.  Request GPS to automatically save this
     desktop when you quit with the :index:`preference <preferences;
     general --> save desktop on exit>` :menuselection:`General --> Save
     Desktop On Exit`.

.. index:: menu; file --> change directory

* :menuselection:`File --> Change Directory...`

  Open a directory selection dialog that lets you change the current
  working directory.

.. index:: menu; file --> locations

* :menuselection:`File --> Locations`

  This submenu gives access to functionalities related to the
  :guilabel:`Locations` window.

  - :menuselection:`File --> Locations --> Export Locations to Editor`

     List the contents of the :guilabel:`Locations` view in an editor.

.. index:: menu; file --> print
.. index:: print

* :menuselection:`File --> Print`

  Print the current window contents, optionally saving it if it was
  modified. The :guilabel:`Print Command` specified in the preferences is
  used if defined. On Unix this command is required; on Windows it is
  optional.

  On Windows, if no command is specified in the preferences, GPS displays
  the standard Windows print dialog box, allowing you to specify the target
  printer, the properties of the printer, which pages to print (all, or a
  specific range of pages), the number of copies to print, and, when more
  than one copy is specified, whether the pages should be collated.
  Pressing the :guilabel:`Cancel` button on the dialog box returns to GPS
  without printing the window contents. Each page is printed with a header
  containing the name of the file (if the window has ever been saved).  The
  page number is printed on the bottom of each page.

  See also:ref:`Print Command <Print_Command>`.

.. index:: menu; file --> close

* :menuselection:`File --> Close`

  Close the current window. This applies to all GPS windows, not just
  source editors.

.. index:: menu; file --> exit

* :menuselection:`File --> Exit`

  Exit GPS after confirmation and, if needed, confirmation about saving
  modified windows and editors.

.. _The_Edit_Menu:

The :menuselection:`Edit` Menu
------------------------------

.. index:: menu; edit --> cut

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Cut`

  Cut the current selection and store it in the clipboard.

.. index:: menu; edit --> copy
.. index:: yank

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Copy`

  Copy the current selection to the clipboard.

.. index:: menu; edit --> paste

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Paste`

  Paste the contents of the clipboard at the current cursor position.

.. index:: menu; edit --> paste previous

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Paste previous`

  GPS stores a list of all the text that was previously copied to the
  clipboard through the use of :guilabel:`Copy` or :guilabel:`Cut`.

  By default, if you press :guilabel:`Paste`, the newest text will be
  inserted at the cursor's current position.  If you pres :guilabel:`Paste
  Previous` (one or more times) immediately after that, you can instead
  paste the text that was copied to the clipboard the previous time.

  For example, if you use :menuselection:`Edit --> Copy` to copy the text
  :samp:`First`, then copy the text :samp:`Second`, select
  :menuselection:`Edit --> Paste` to insert :samp:`Second` at the current
  cursor position. If you then select :menuselection:`Edit --> Paste
  Previous`, :samp:`Second` is replaced by :samp:`First`. When reaching the
  end of this list, GPS starts from the beginning and again inserts the
  text that was copied to the clipboard most recently.

  The size of this list is controlled by the :menuselection:`General -->
  Clipboard Size` :index:`preference <preferences; general --> clipboard
  size>`.

  For more information, see :ref:`The_Clipboard_View`.

.. index:: menu; edit --> undo

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Undo`

  Undo previous insertion or deletion in the current editor.

.. index:: menu; edit --> redo

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Redo`

  Redo previous insertion or deletion in the current editor.

.. index:: menu; edit --> rectangles

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Rectangles...`

  See the section :ref:`Rectangles` for more information on rectangles.

.. index:: menu; edit --> rectangles --> serialize

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Rectangles... -> Serialize`

  Increment a set of numbers found on adjacent lines.  The behavior depends
  on whether or not there is a current selection.

  If there is no selection, the set of lines modified begins with the
  current line and includes all adjacent lines that have at least one digit
  in the same column as the cursor. In the following example, '|' marks the
  place where the cursor starts::

     AAA |10 AAA
     CCC 34567 CCC
     DDD DDD

  Only the first two lines are modified and become::

     AAA 10 AAA
     CCC 11 CCC
     DDD DDD

  If there is a selection, all the lines in the selection are modified. For
  each line, the columns of each line that had digits in the same column of
  the first line are modified. Starting from the original example above, if
  you select all three lines, the replacement becomes::

     AAA 10 AAA
     CCC 11567 CCC
     DDD 12D

  Only the fifth and sixth columns are modified since only those
  columns contained digits in the first line.

  This feature assumes you selected a relevant set of lines. But it is
  designed most specifically for modifying blank parts of lines. For
  example, if you start with::

     AAA 1
     BBB
     CCC

  it becomes::

     AAA 1
     BBB 2
     CCC 3

.. index:: menu; edit --> select all

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Select all`

  Select the entire contents of the current source editor.

.. index:: menu; edit --> insert file

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Insert File...`

  Open a file selection dialog and insert the contents of that file in the
  current source editor at the current cursor position.

.. index:: menu; edit --> insert shell output

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Insert Shell Output...`

  Open an input window at the bottom of the GPS window where you can
  specify any external command.  If the command succeeds, the output
  of the command is inserted at the current cursor position, or, if text
  is selected, the text is passed to the external command and replaced
  by the command's output.

.. index:: menu; edit --> format selection

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Format selection`

  Indent and format the selection or the current line.  See
  :ref:`The_Preferences_Dialog` for preferences related to source
  formatting.

.. index:: menu; edit --> smart completion
.. index:: completion
.. _Smart_Completion:

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Smart completion`

  Complete the identifier prefix under the cursor and list the results in a
  pop-up window.  When used with Ada sources, this takes advantage of an
  entity database as well as Ada parsers embedded in GPS which analyze the
  context and offer completions from the entire project along with
  documentation extracted from comments surrounding declarations. To take
  full advantage of this feature, you must have the smart completion
  enabled, which causes the computation of the entity database at GPS
  startup.

  .. index:: gcc; -fdump-xref

  Support for C and C++ is not as powerful as the support for Ada since it
  relies completely on the cross-reference information files generated by
  the compiler, does not take into account the C/C++ context around the
  cursor, and does not extract documentation from comments around candidate
  declarations. To take advantage of this feature, you must enable the
  smart completion preference and build your C/C++ application with
  :command:`-fdump-xref`.

  In order to use this feature, open any Ada, C, or C++ file and start
  typing an identifier, which must be declared either in the current file
  (and accessible from the cursor location) or in one of the packages of
  the loaded project.  Move the cursor after the last character of the
  incomplete identifier and hit the completion key (:kbd:`control-space` by
  default).  GPS opens a popup displaying all known identifiers that begin
  with the prefix you typed.  Browse among the various possibilities by
  clicking on the :kbd:`up` and :kbd:`down` keys or using the left
  scrollbar. For each entity, GPS displays a documentation box. If the
  location of the entity is known, it is displayed as an hyperlink and you
  can jump directly to its declaration by clicking on it.

  Typing additional letters reduces the range of possibilities, as long as
  possibilities remain. Once you have selected the expected completion,
  confirm it by pressing :kbd:`Enter`.  Typing any character which cannot be
  used in identifiers, including control characters, also confirms the
  current selection.

  GPS can also automatically complete subprogram parameters or dotted
  notation for child and nested packages. For example, if you type::

    with Ada.

  a smart completion window appears, listing all child and nested packages
  of Ada. You can configure the time interval after which the completion
  window appears (see :ref:`The_Preferences_Dialog`).

  You can also type the beginning of the package, e.g.::

    with Ada.Text

  Pressing the completion key offers you Text_IO.

  If you are in a code section, you can complete the fields of a record, or
  the contents of a package, e.g.::

     declare
       type R is record
          Field1 : Integer;
          Field2 : Integer;
       end record;

       V : R;
    begin
       V.

  Completing V. proposes Field1 and Field2.

  Smart completion also lists the possible parameters of a call you are
  currently making. For example, in the following code::

    procedure Proc (A, B, C : Integer);
    begin
       Proc (1,

  If you hit the completion key after the comma, the smart completion
  engine proposes completing with the named parameters "B =>", "C =>" or
  completing with all the remaining parameters, in this case "B =>, C =>
  )".

  .. image:: smart-completion.jpg

  Limitations:

  * This feature is currently only available for Ada, C, and C++. Using
    the smart completion on sources of other languages behaves as the
    :ref:`identifier completion <Complete_Identifier>` does.

  * Smart completion for C and C++ is based on the cross-reference
    information generated by the compiler. Therefore, GPS has no knowledge
    of recently edited files: you must rebuild with :command:`-fdump-xref`
    to update the completion database.

  * Smart completion for C and C++ is only triggered at the beginning of an
    expression and by special characters such as '(', '->', or the C++
    operator '::' and may propose too many candidates since it does not have
    knowlege of the C/C++ syntax context. Typing new letters reduces the
    range of possibilities, as long as possibilitites remain.

  * Smart completion of subprogram parameters, fields and dotted
    notation are not yet available for C and C++.

.. index:: rectangle
.. index:: menu; edit --> rectangles
.. _Rectangles:

Rectangles
==========

Rectangle commands operate on a rectangular area of the text, specifically
all the characters between two columns in a certain range of lines.

Select a rectangle using the standard selection mechanism.  Either use the
mouse to highlight the proper region, use :kbd:`shift` and the cursor keys
to extend the selection, or use the Emacs selection (with the mark and the
current cursor location) if you have activated the Emacs key themes in
the Key Shortcuts editor (:ref:`The_Key_Shortcuts_Editor`).

Visually, a selected rectangle appears exactly the same as the standard
selection.  In particular, the characters after the last column on each
line are also highlighted. Whether a selection is interpreted as full text
or a rectangle depends on the entry you use to manipulate the selection.

If you use one of the entries from the :menuselection:`Edit --> Rectangles`
menu, the rectangle extends from the top-left corner to the bottom-right
corner.  All characters to the right of the right-most column, although
highlighted, are not considered part of the rectangle.

Consider for example the following text::

  package A is
     procedure P;

     procedure Q;
  end A;


and assume you have selected from the character "p" in "procedure P" down to
the character "c" in "procedure Q".

You can then use one of the following entries (either from the menu or key
shortcuts assigned to them via the usual :menuselection:`Edit --> Key
shortcuts` menu).

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Rectangles --> Cut` or :menuselection:`Edit -->
  Rectangles --> Delete`

  Remove the selected text (and have no effect on empty lines within the
  rectangle). The former entry will, in addition, copy the rectangle to the
  clipboard so you can paste it later. In our example, you end up with::

    package A is
       edure P;

       edure Q;
    end A;

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Rectangles --> Copy`

  Copies the contents of the rectangle into the clipboard without
  affecting the current editor.

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Rectangles --> Paste`

  Pastes the contents of the clipboard as a rectangle: each line from the
  clipboard is treated independently and inserted on successive lines in
  the current editor. They all start in the same column (the one where the
  cursor was initially in) and existing text in the editor lines is shifted
  to the right. If, for example, you now place the cursor in the first
  column of the second line and paste, you end up with::

    package A is
    proc   edure P;

    proc   edure Q;
    end A;

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Rectangles --> Clear`

  Replaces the contents of the selected rectangle with spaces. If you start
  from our initial exmaple, you end up with the following. Note the
  difference between this and :menuselection:`Edit --> Rectangles -->
  Delete` menu::

    package A is
           edure P;

           edure Q;
    end A;

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Rectangles --> Open`

  Replaces the contents of the selected rectangle with spaces but shifts
  the lines to the right to do so. Note the difference between this and the
  :menuselection:`Edit --> Rectangles --> Clear` menu::

    package A is
           procedure P;

           procedure Q;
    end A;

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Rectangles --> Replace With Text`

  Similar to :menuselection:`Edit --> Rectangles --> Clear` but the
  rectangle is replaced with user-defined text. The lines are shifted left
  or right if the inserted text is shorter (respectively, longer) than the
  width of the rectangle. This command affects lines that are empty in the
  initial rectangle.  If, for example, you replace our initial rectangle
  with the text "TMP", you end up with the following. Note that the
  character "c" has disappeared, since "TMP" is shorter than our rectangle
  width (4 characters)::

    package A is
       TMPedure P;
       TMP
       TMPedure Q;
    end A;

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Rectangles --> Insert Text`

  Inserts text to the left of the rectangle on each line. The following
  example inserts :samp:`TMP`. Note the difference between this command and
  :menuselection:`Edit --> Rectangles --> Replace With Text`. This command
  also inserts the text on lines that are empty in the initial rectangle::

    package A is
       TMPprocedure P;
       TMP
       TMPprocedure Q;
    end A;

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Rectangles --> Sort`

  Sorts the selected lines according to the key which starts and ends on
  the rectangle's columns::

    aaa 15 aa
    bbb 02 bb
    ccc 09 cc

  With a selection starting from the 1 on the first line and ending on the
  9 on the last, the lines are sorted as follows::

    bbb 02 bb
    ccc 09 cc
    aaa 15 aa

* :menuselection:`Edit --> Rectangles --> Sort reverse`

  As above but in the reverse order.


.. index:: macros
.. _Recording_and_replaying_macros:

Recording and replaying macros
==============================

It is often convenient to be able to repeat a given key sequence a number of
times.

GPS supports this with several different methods:

* Repeat the next action

  .. index:: action; repeat next

  If you want to repeat the action of pressing a single key, first use the
  GPS action :guilabel:`Repeat Next` (bound by default to :kbd:`control-u`,
  but this can be changed as usual through the :menuselection:`Edit --> Key
  Shortcuts` menu), entering the number of times you wish to repeat, and
  then pressing the key whose action you want to repeat.

  For example, the sequence :kbd:`control-u 79 -` inserts 79 characters of
  '-' in the current editor.  This is often useful to insert separators.

  If you are using the Emacs mode (see :menuselection:`Tools --> Plug-ins`
  menu), you can also use the sequence :kbd:`control-u 30 control-k` to
  delete 30 lines.

* Recording macros

  .. index:: menu; tools --> macros

  To repeat a sequence of more than 1 key, record the sequence as a
  macro. All macro-related menus are found in the :menuselection:`Tools -->
  Macros` menu, but it is often more convenient to use these through key
  bindings, which you can of course override.

  First, tell GPS to should start recording the keys you are pressing via
  the :menuselection:`Tools --> Macros --> Start Keyboard Macro` menu.  As
  its name indicates, this only records keyboard events, not mouse events.
  GPS keeps recording the events until you select the :menuselection:`Tools
  --> Macros --> Stop Macro` menu.

  In Emacs mode, macro actions are bound to :kbd:`control-x (`,
  :kbd:`control-x )` and :kbd:`control-x e` key shortcuts. For example, you
  can execute the following to create a very simple macro that deletes the
  current line wherever your cursor initially is on that line:

  *  :kbd:`control-x (`     start recording
  *  :kbd:`control-a`      go to beginning of line
  *  :kbd:`control-k`      delete line
  *  :kbd:`control-x )`     stop recording


.. index:: automatic casing; exceptions
.. _Contextual_Menus_for_Editing_Files:

Contextual Menus for Editing Files
==================================

Whenever you ask for a contextual menu (using, for example, the right
button on your mouse) on a source file, you get access to a number of
entries, which are displayed or hidden depending on the current context.

These menu entries include the following categories:

*Source Navigation*

  See :ref:`Contextual_Menus_for_Source_Navigation`.

*Dependencies*

  See :ref:`The_Dependency_Browser`.

*Entity browsing*

  See :ref:`Entity_Browser`.

*Project view*

  See :ref:`The_Project_View`.

*Version control*

  See :ref:`The_Version_Control_Contextual_Menu`.

*Debugger*

  See :ref:`Using_the_Source_Editor_when_Debugging`.

*Case exceptions*

  See :ref:`Handling_of_case_exceptions`.

*Refactoring*

  See :ref:`Refactoring`.

.. index:: language, editor
.. index:: character set

In addition, an entry :menuselection:`Properties...` is always visible in
this contextual menu. When you select it, a dialog allows you to override
the language or the character set used for the file.  This is useful when
opening a file that does not belong to the current project but where you
want to benefit from the syntax highlighting, which depends on knowing the
file's language.

Do not override the language for source files belonging to the current
project. Instead, use the :menuselection:`Project --> Edit Project
Properties` menu and change the naming scheme as appropriate. This provides
better consistency between GPS and the compiler in the way they manipulate
the file.

.. index:: casing; automatic
.. _Handling_of_case_exceptions:

Handling of casing
==================

GPS maintains a dictionary of identifiers and a corresponding casing that
are used by all case-insensitive languages. When editing or reformatting a
buffer for such a language, the dictionary is checked first. If GPS finds
an entry for a word or a substring of a word, it is used; otherwise the
specified default casing for keywords or identifiers is used. A substring
is defined as a part of the word separated by underscores.

.. index:: preferences; editor --> ada --> casing policy
.. index:: preferences; editor --> ada --> reserved word casing
.. index:: preferences; editor --> ada --> identifier casing

This feature is not activated for entities (keywords or identifiers) for
which the casing is set to :guilabel:`Unchanged` in the
:menuselection:`Editor --> Ada --> Reserved word casing` or
:menuselection:`Editor --> Ada --> Identifier casing` preferences.

A contextual menu named :menuselection:`Casing` has the following entries:

* :menuselection:`Casing --> Lower *entity*`

  Set the selected entity to be in lower case.

* :menuselection:`Casing --> Upper *entity*`

  Set the selected entity to be in upper case.

* :menuselection:`Casing --> Mixed *entity*`

  Set the selected entity to be in mixed case (the first letter and letters
  before an underscore are in upper case and all other letters are in lower
  case).

* :menuselection:`Casing --> Smart Mixed *entity*`

  Set the selected entity as smart mixed case, which is the same as above
  except that upper case letters are kept unchanged.

* :menuselection:`Casing --> Add exception for *entity*`

  Add the current entity into the dictionary.

* :menuselection:`Casing --> Remove exception for *entity*`

  Remove the current entity from the dictionary.

To add or remove a substring from the dictionary, first select the
substring in the editor.  Then, the last two contextual menu entries will
be:

* :menuselection:`Casing --> Add substring exception for *str*`

  Add the selected substring into the dictionary.

* :menuselection:`Casing --> Remove substring exception for *str*`

  Remove the selected substring from the dictionary.


.. index:: refactoring
.. _Refactoring:

Refactoring
===========

GPS includes basic facilities to refactor your code.  "Refactoring" is the
term used to describe manipulation of source code that does not affect the
behavior of the code but helps reorganize it to make it more readable, more
extendable, or make other similar improvements.  Refactoring techniques are
generally things that programmers have done by hand, but which can be done
faster and more securely when done automatically by a tool.

A basic recommendations when you refactor your code is to recompile and
test your application regularly to make sure each small modification you
made did not change the behavior of your application.  This is particularly
true with GPS, since it relies on the cross-references information
generated by the compiler. If some source files have not been recompiled
recently, GPS prints warning messages indicating that the operation might
be dangerous and/or only partially performed.

One of the reference books used in the choice of refactoring methods for
GPS is "Refactoring", by Martin Fowler (Addison Wesley).

.. _Rename_Entity:

Rename Entity
-------------

Clicking on an entity in a source file and selecting the
:menuselection:`Refactoring --> Rename` contextual menu opens a dialog
asking for the new name of the entity. GPS renames all instances of the
entity in your application, including the definition of the entity, its
body, and all calls to it.  No comments are updated so you should probably
manually check that the comment for the entity still applies.

GPS handles primitive operations by also renaming the operations it
overrides or that overrides it, so any dispatching call to that operation
is also renamed, allowing the application to continue to work properly. If
you are renaming a parameter to a subprogram, GPS also renames parameters
with the same name in overriding or overridden subprograms.

You can specify the behavior for read-only files: by default, GPS wil not do
any refactoring in these files and instead displays a dialog listing them.
However, you can choose to make them writable just as if you had clicked on
the :guilabel:`Read-Only` button in the status bar of the editor and have
GPS perform the renaming in them as well.

.. _Name_Parameters:

Name Parameters
---------------

If you are editing Ada code and click on a call to a subprogram, GPS
displays a :menuselection:`Refactoring --> Name parameters` contextual
menu, which replaces all unnamed parameters by named parameters, for
example::

     Call (1, 2)
  =>
     Call (Param1 => 1, Param2 => 2);


.. _Extract_Subprogram:

Extract Subprogram
------------------

This refactoring moves some code into a separate subprogram to simplify the
original subprogram by moving part of its code elsewhere.  Here is an
example from the "Refactoring" book. The refactoring takes place in the
body of the package :file:`pkg.adb`, but the spec is needed so you can
compile the source code (a preliminary, but mandatory, step before you can
refactor the code)::

  pragma Ada_05;

  with Ada.Containers.Indefinite_Doubly_Linked_Lists;
  with Ada.Strings.Unbounded;

  package Pkg is

     type Order is tagged null record;
     function Get_Amount (Self : Order) return Integer;

     package Order_Listsis new
        Ada.Containers.Indefinite_Doubly_Linked_Lists (Order);

     type Invoice is tagged record
        Orders : Order_Lists.List;
        Name   : Ada.Strings.Unbounded.Unbounded_String;
     end record;

     procedure Print_Owing (Self : Invoice);

  end Pkg;

An initial implementation for this is the following::

  pragma Ada_05;
  with Ada.Strings.Unbounded;  use Ada.Strings.Unbounded;
  with Ada.Text_IO;            use Ada.Text_IO;

  package body Pkg is
     use Order_Lists;

     ----------------
     -- Get_Amount --
     ----------------

     function Get_Amount (Self : Order) return Integer is
     begin
        return 0;
     end Get_Amount;

     -----------------
     -- Print_Owing --
     -----------------

     procedure Print_Owing (Self : Invoice) is
        E : Order_Lists.Cursor := First (Self.Orders);
        Outstanding : Natural := 0;
        Each : Order;
     begin
        --  <<< line 30
        --  Print Banner

        Put_Line ("");
        Put_Line (" Customer Owes         ");
        Put_Line ("");  --  << line 35

        --  Calculate Outstanding

        while Has_Element (E) loop
           Each := Element (E);
           Outstanding := Outstanding + Each.Get_Amount;
           Next (E);
        end loop;

        --  Print Details

        Put_Line ("Name: " & To_String (Self.Name));
        Put_Line ("Outstanding:" & Outstanding'Img);
     end Print_Owing;
  end Pkg;

Suppose we feel the procedure :command:`Print_Owing` is too long and does
several independent actions.  We will perform a series of three successive
refactoring steps to extract the code and move it elsewhere.

First, we move the code that prints the banner. Moving it is easy, since
this code does not depend on any context. We could just do a copy-paste,
but then we would have to create the new subprogram. Instead, we select lines
30 to 35 and then select the :menuselection:`Refactoring --> Extract
Subprogram` contextual menu.  GPS removes those lines from the subprogram
:command:`Print_Owing` and creates a new procedure :command:`Print_Banner`
(the name is specified by the user; GPS does not try to guess a name). Also,
since the chunk of code that is extracted starts with a comment, GPS
automatically uses that comment as the documentation for the new
subprogram.  Here is the relevant part of the resulting file::

  package body Pkg is

     procedure Print_Banner;
     --  Print Banner

     ------------------
     -- Print_Banner --
     ------------------

     procedure Print_Banner is
     begin
        Put_Line ("");
        Put_Line (" Customer Owes         ");
        Put_Line ("");
     end Print_Banner;

     ... (code not shown)

     procedure Print_Owing (Self : Invoice) is
        E : Order_Lists.Cursor := First (Self.Orders);
        Outstanding : Natural := 0;
        Each : Order;
     begin
        Print_Banner;

        --  Calculate Outstanding

        while Has_Element (E) loop
           Each := Element (E);
           Outstanding := Outstanding + Each.Get_Amount;
           Next (E);
        end loop;

        --  Print Details   <<< line  54

        Put_Line ("Name: " & To_String (Self.Name));
        Put_Line ("Outstanding:" & Outstanding'Img);  --  line 57
     end Print_Owing;
  end Pkg;

A more interesting example is when we want to extract the code to print the
details of the invoice. This code depends on one local variable and the
parameter to :command:`Print_Owing`.  When we select lines 54 to 57 and
extract it into a new :command:`Print_Details` subprogram, GPS
automatically decides which variables to extract and whether they should
become parameters of the new subprogram or local variables. In the former
case, it also automatically decides whether to create :samp:`in`,
:samp:`out` or :samp:`in out` parameters. If there is a single :samp:`out`
parameter, GPS automatically creates a function instead of a procedure.

GPS uses the same name for the local variable for the parameters. Often, it
makes sense to recompile the new version of the source and apply the
:menuselection:`Refactoring --> Rename Entity` refactoring to have more
specific names for the parameters, or the :menuselection:`Refactoring -->
Name Parameters` refactoring so that calls to the new method uses named
parameters to further clarify the code::

     ... code not shown

     procedure Print_Details
       (Self : Invoice'Class;
        Outstanding : Natural);
     --  Print Details

     -------------------
     -- Print_Details --
     -------------------

     procedure Print_Details
       (Self : Invoice'Class;
        Outstanding : Natural)
     is
     begin
        Put_Line ("Name: " & To_String (Self.Name));
        Put_Line ("Outstanding:" & Outstanding'Img);
     end Print_Details;

     procedure Print_Owing (Self : Invoice) is
        E : Order_Lists.Cursor := First (Self.Orders);
        Outstanding : Natural := 0;
        Each : Order;
     begin
        Print_Banner;

        --  Calculate Outstanding

        while Has_Element (E) loop
           Each := Element (E);
           Outstanding := Outstanding + Each.Get_Amount;
           Next (E);
        end loop;

        Print_Details (Self, Outstanding);
     end Print_Owing;

Finally, we want to extract the code that computes the outstanding
balance. When this code is moved, the variables :command:`E` and
:command:`Each` become dead in :command:`Print_Owing` and are moved into
the new subprogram (which we call :command:`Get_Outstanding`). The initial
selection should include the blank lines before and after the code to keep
the resulting :command:`Print_Owing` simpler. GPS automatically ignores
those blank lines.  Here is the result of that last refactoring ::

     ... code not shown

     procedure Get_Outstanding (Outstanding : in out Natural);
     --  Calculate Outstanding

     ---------------------
     -- Get_Outstanding --
     ---------------------

     procedure Get_Outstanding (Outstanding : in out Natural) is
        E : Order_Lists.Cursor := First (Self.Orders);
        Each : Order;
     begin
        while Has_Element (E) loop
           Each := Element (E);
           Outstanding := Outstanding + Each.Get_Amount;
           Next (E);
        end loop;
     end Get_Outstanding;

     procedure Print_Owing (Self : Invoice) is
        Outstanding : Natural := 0;
     begin
        Print_Banner;
        Get_Outstanding (Outstanding);
        Print_Details (Self, Outstanding);
     end Print_Owing;

The final version of :command:`Print_Owing` is not perfect. For example,
passing the initial value 0 to :command:`Get_Outstanding` is useless and,
in fact, it should probably be a function with no parameter. But GPS
already saves a lot of time and manipulation even given these
imperfections.

Finally, a word of caution: this refactoring does not check that you are
starting with valid input. For example, if the text you select includes a
:command:`declare` block, you should always include the full block, not
just a part of it (or select text between :command:`begin` and
:command:`end`). Likewise, GPS does not expect you to select any part of the
variable declarations, just the code.


.. index:: external editor
.. _Using_an_External_Editor:

Using an External Editor
========================

.. index:: preferences; editor --> external editor

GPS is integrated with a number of external editors, in particular
:program:`emacs` and :program:`vi`. The choice of the default external
editor is done in the :menuselection:`Editor --> External editor`
preference.

The following values are recognized:

.. index:: gnuclient

* :program:`gnuclient`

  This is the recommended client. It is based on Emacs, but needs an extra
  package to be installed. This is the only client providing a full
  integration in GPS, since any extended lisp command can be sent to the
  Emacs server.

  By default, :program:`gnuclient` opens a new Emacs frame for every file
  you open. You might want to add the following code to your :file:`.emacs`
  file (create one if needed) so that the same Emacs frame is reused each
  time::

       (setq gnuserv-frame (car (frame-list)))

  See `http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/ange/gnuserv/home.html
  <http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/ange/gnuserv/home.html>`_ for more
  information.


.. index:: emacsclient

* :program:`emacsclient`

  This is a program that is always available if you have installed Emacs. As
  opposed to starting a new Emacs every time, it reuses an existing Emacs
  sessions, so it is extremely fast to open a file.

.. index:: emacs

* :program:`emacs`

  This clients start a new Emacs session every time a file needs to be
  opened. You should use :program:`emacsclient` instead, since it is much
  faster and makes it easier to copy and paste between multiple files.  The
  only reason to use this external editor is if your system does not support
  :program:`emacsclient`.


.. index:: vi

* :program:`vim`

  `Vim` is a vi-like editor that provides a number of enhancements, for
  example, syntax highlighting for all languages supported by GPS.
  Selecting this external editor starts an :program:`xterm` (or command
  window, depending on your system) with a running :program:`vim` process
  editing the file.

  One limitation of this editor is that if GPS needs to open the same file
  a second time, it opens a new editor instead of reusing the existing one.

  To enable this capability, the :program:`xterm` executable must be found
  in the PATH and thus this is not supported on Windows systems.  On
  Windows systems, use the :command:`program` editor instead.

* :program:`vi`

  This editor works exactly like :program:`vim`, but uses the standard
  :program:`vi` command instead of :program:`vim`.

.. index:: preferences; editor --> custom editor command

* :program:`custom`

  Specify any external editor by choosing this entry.  Specify the complete
  command line used to call the editor in the :menuselection:`Editor -->
  Custom editor command` preference.

* :program:`none`

  No external editor is used and the contextual menus do not appear.

In the cases that require an Emacs server, the project file currently used
in GPS is set appropriately the first time Emacs is spawned. This means
that if you load a new project in GPS or modify the paths of the current
project, you should kill any running Emacs, so a new one is spawned by GPS
with the appropriate project.

Alternatively, explicitly reload the project from Emacs itself by using the
:menuselection:`Project --> Load` menu in :program:`emacs` (if
:command:`ada-mode` is correctly installed).

.. index:: preferences; editor --> always use external editor

The :menuselection:`Editor --> Always use external editor` preference lets
you chose to use an external editor every time you double-click on a file,
instead of opening GPS's own editor.

.. index:: clipboard
.. index:: cut
.. index:: copy
.. index:: yank
.. index:: paste
.. _Using_the_Clipboard:

Using the Clipboard
===================

This section is of interest to X-Window users who are used to cutting and
pasting with the middle mouse button. In the GPS text editor, as in many
recent X applications, the :guilabel:`GPS clipboard` is set by explicit
cut/copy/paste actions, either through menu items or keyboard shortcuts,
and the :guilabel:`primary clipboard` (i.e. the 'middle button' clipboard)
is set to the current selection.

Therefore, copy/paste between GPS and other X applications using the
:guilabel:`primary clipboard` still work provided there is text currently
selected. The :guilabel:`GPS clipboard`, when set, overrides the
:guilabel:`primary clipboard`.

By default, GPS overrides the X mechanism. To prevent this, add the
following line::

  OVERRIDE_MIDDLE_CLICK_PASTE = no

to your :file:`traces.cfg` file (typically in :file:`~/.gps/`). Note that
the X mechanism pastes all attributes of text, including coloring and
editability, which can be confusing.

.. index:: saving
.. _Saving_Files:

Saving Files
============

.. index:: menu; file --> save

After you have finished editing your files, you need to save them.  Do so by
selecting the :menuselection:`File --> Save` menu, which saves the
currently selected file.

.. index:: menu; file --> save as

Use the :menuselection:`File --> Save As...` menu if you want to save the
file with another name or in another directory.

.. index:: menu; file --> save more --> all

If you have multiple files to save, use the :menuselection:`File --> Save
More --> All` menu, which opens a dialog listing all the currently modified
editors.  Select which ones should be saved and click on :guilabel:`Save`
to save those editors.

.. index:: preferences; editor --> autosave delay
.. index:: saving; automatic

When calling external commands, such as compiling a file, if the
:menuselection:`Editor --> Autosave delay` preference is set to 0, this
same dialog is also used to make sure the external command sees your
changes.  If the preference is enabled, editors are saved automatically.

.. image:: save-dialog.jpg

Conveniently select or unselect all the files at once by clicking on the
title of the first column (labeled :guilabel:`Select`). This toggles the
selection status of all files.

If you press :guilabel:`Cancel` instead of :guilabel:`Save`, nothing is
saved and the action that displayed this dialog is also canceled. Such
actions can be, for example, starting a compilation command, a VCS
operation, or quitting GPS with unsaved files.
