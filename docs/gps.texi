@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction
@cindex introduction
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
GPS is a complete integrated development environment that gives access
to a wide range of tools and integrates them smoothly.

@cindex HTML
@cindex help
GPS gives access to built-in file editing; HTML based help system;
complete compile/build/run cycle; intelligent source navigation;
project management; general graph technology giving access to many different
browsers such as source dependency, project dependency, call graphs, etc@dots{};
fully integrated visual debugger, based on the GVD technology, and enhanced
for inclusion in GPS; generic version control system, providing access
to CVS, ClearCase, and possibly others in the future; many other tools
such as a visual comparison, automatic generation of files, source reformatting.

@cindex customization
GPS is fully customizable, providing several levels of customizations:
a first level, available through the preferences and key manager dialogs;
a second level, which allows you to customize your menu items, tool bar and key
bindings; a third level, which allows you to automate processing through
scripts; and a fourth level, which allows any kind of very specific or tight
integration, due to the open nature of GPS, and to its architecture.
See @ref{Customizing and Extending GPS} for more details.

@cindex editor
@cindex emacs
GPS also integrates with existing editors such as Emacs and Vi, see
@ref{Using an External Editor}.

@end ifhtml

@noindent
When starting GPS, a welcome dialog is displayed by default, giving the
following choices:

@table @b
@item Start with default project in directory
@cindex project
If you select this option and click on the @code{OK} button, GPS will create a
default internal project with the following properties:

@cindex Ada
@cindex GNAT
  The project supports Ada files only, using the default GNAT
  naming scheme: @code{.ads} for spec files, @code{.adb} for body files.

  A single source directory corresponding to the current directory.
  The current directory can be set by modifying the text entry on clicking
  on the @code{Browse} button. All the Ada files found in this directory
  will be considered as part of the default project.

  The object directory where the object and executable files will
  be put, corresponding also to the current directory.

@item Create new project with wizard
@cindex project
Selecting this option and clicking on the @code{OK} button will start a
wizard allowing you to specify most of the properties for a new project. Once
the project is created, GPS will save it and load it automatically.
See @ref{The Project Wizard} for more details on the project wizard.

@item Open existing project
@cindex project
You can select an existing project by clicking on the @code{Browse} button,
or by using a previously loaded project listed in the combo box. When a
project is selected, clicking on the @code{OK} button will load this
project and open the main window.

@item Always show this dialog when GPS starts
If unset, the welcome dialog won't be shown in future sessions.
In this case, GPS will behave as follows: it will first look for a
@code{-P} switch on the command line, and load the corresponding project if
present.
Then, it will look for a project file in the current directory and will
load the first project file found.

If no project file can be found in the current directory, GPS will start
with the default project.

To reset this property, go to the menu @code{Edit->Preferences}.
@cindex preferences
@xref{The Preferences Dialog}.

@item Quit
If you click on this button, GPS will terminate immediately.
@end table

@cindex command line
When you specify a -P switch on the command line, or if there is only one
project file in the current directory, GPS will start immediately with
the project file specified, instead of displaying the welcome dialog.

In addition, if you specify source files on the command line, GPS will also
start immediately, using the default project if no project is specified.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node The Menu Bar
@section The Menu Bar
@cindex menu bar
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
This is a standard menu bar that gives access to all the global
functionalities of GPS. It is usually easier to access a given functionality
using the various contextual menus provided throughout GPS: these menus
give direct access to the most relevant actions given the current context
(e.g. a project, a directory, a file, an entity, @dots{}). Contextual menus
pop up when the right mouse button is clicked.

The menu bar gives access to the following items:

@table @b

@item File
@xref{The File Menu}.

@item Edit
@xref{The Edit Menu}.

@item Navigate
@xref{The Navigate Menu}.

@item VCS

@end table

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node The Tool Bar
@section The Tool Bar
@cindex tool bar
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
The tool bar provides shortcuts via buttons to some typical actions:
creating a new file, opening a file, saving the current file;
undo/redo last editing;
@cindex clipboard
cut to clipboard, copy to clipboard, paste from clipboard;
go to previous/next location;
@cindex debugger
start/continue the debugging session, step/next execution, finish
current procedure.

The icon on the far right of the tool bar will be animated to indicate that an
action (e.g. a build or a search) is going on in the background.

@node The Work Space
@section The Work Space

The whole work space is based on a multiple document interface,
@xref{Multiple Document Interface}.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node The Project Explorer
@section The Project Explorer
@cindex project explorer
@cindex project
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
The project explorer is composed of multiple views which can be accessed
by default by clicking on the corresponding pages, or if they are not shown
by using the @code{Project} menu items.

@subsection The explorer views
@cindex explorer views

@noindent
The explorer views are
initially displayed on the left side of the GPS window. Their goal is to
show a full view of the various components of your projects. These
various components are presented below.

@cindex drag-n-drop
Under Windows, it is possible to drop files (coming e.g. from the Explorer)
in any of these views with the following behavior: a project file dropped
will be loaded; any other file will open a source editor on this file.

The following screen-shot displays the two pages side-by-side: on the
left, the @code{Project View}, and on the right the @code{File View}.

@iftex
@cindex screen shot
@image{explorer-views, 10.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@cindex screen shot
@image{explorer-views}
@end ifhtml

@cindex interactive search
Each view provides an interactive search capability allowing you to quickly
search in the information currently displayed. The default key
to start an interactive search is @key{Ctrl-i}. See @ref{Interactive Search}
for more details.

The various components that are displayed in these explorers are the
following:

@table @b
@item projects
@cindex project view
As mentioned before, all the sources you are working with are put under
control of projects. These projects are a way to store the switches to
use for the various tools, as well as a number of other properties.

They can be organized into a project hierarchy, where a root project
can import other projects, with their own set of sources.

Initially, a default project is created, that includes all the sources
in the current directory.

The @code{Project View} page of the explorer displays this project
hierarchy: the top node in this view is the root project of your
application (generally, this is where the source file that contains
the main subprogram will be located). Then a node is displayed for
each imported project, and recursively for their own imported
projects.

A given project might appear multiple times in the
@code{Project View}, if it is imported by several other projects.

There exists a second display for this project view, which lists
all projects with no hierarchy: all projects appear only once in the explorer,
at the top level. This display might be useful for deep project hierarchies, to
make it easier to find projects in the explorer.

@cindex Show flat view
This display is activated through the contextual menu entry
@code{Show flat view}, which acts as a switch between the two displays.

A special icon with an exclamation mark is displayed if the project
was modified, but not saved yet. You can choose to save it at any time
by right-clicking on it. GPS will remind you to save it before any
compilation.

@item directories
@cindex directory
@cindex Windows
The files inside a project can be organized into several physical
directories on the disk. These directories are displayed under each
project node in the @code{Project View}, or directly mimicking their
physical organization on the disk (including Windows drives) in the
@code{File View}.

@cindex Show absolute paths
In the @code{Project View}, you can chose whether you want to see the
absolute path names for the directories or paths relative to the
location of the project. This is done through the @code{Show absolute
paths} contextual menu.

Special nodes are created for object and executables directories. No
files are shown for these.

@item files
@cindex file
@cindex file view
The source files themselves are stored in the directories, and
displayed under the corresponding nodes. Note that in the
@code{Project View}, only the source files that actually belong to the
project (i.e. are written in a language supported by that project and
follow its naming scheme) are actually visible.
For more information on supported languages, @xref{Supported Languages}.


@cindex Show files from project only
The @code{File View} will display all the files that actually exist
on the disk. Filters can be set through the contextual menu to only
show the files and directories that belong to the project
hierarchy. See the menu @code{Show files from project only}.

A given file might appear multiple times in the @code{Project View},
if the project it belongs to is imported by several other projects.

@item entities
@cindex entity
If you open the node for a source file, the file is parsed by one of the
fast parsers integrated in GPS so that all entities declared in
the project can be shown. These entities are grouped into various
categories, which depend on the language. Typical categories include
subprograms, packages, types, variables, tasks,@dots{}

@end table

Double-clicking on a file, or simple clicking on any entity will open
a source editor and display respectively the first line in this file
or the line on which the entity is defined.

@cindex search
@cindex find
If you open the search dialog through the @code{Navigate->Find...}
menu, you have the possibility to search for anything in the explorer,
either a file or an entity. Note that searching for an entity might be
a little slow if you have lots of files.

@cindex explorer
@cindex locate in explorer
A contextual menu, named @code{Locate in Explorer}, is also provided when
inside a source editor. This will automatically search for the first entry for
this file in the explorer. This contextual menu is also available in other
modules, e.g. when selecting a file in the @code{Dependency Browser}.


@subsection The configuration variables
@cindex configuration variable
@cindex project variable
@cindex variable

@cindex GNAT
@cindex project file
@cindex project
@noindent
As described in the GNAT User's Guide, the project files can be
configured through external variables (typically environment
variables). This means that e.g. the exact list of source files, or the
exact switches to use to compile the application can be changed when
the value of these external variables is changed.

GPS provides a simple access to these variables, through a special
area on top of the @code{Project View}. These variables are called
@code{Configuration Variables}, since they provide various scenarios for
the same set of project files.

A combo box is displayed in this area for each environment
variable the project depends on. The current value of the variable can
be set simply by selecting it from the pop-down window that appears
when you click on the arrow on the right of the variable name

@cindex project view
New variables can be added through the contextual menu @code{Add
Configuration Variable} in the @code{Project View}. The list of
possible values for a variable can be changed by clicking on the
button on the left of the variable's name.

Whenever you change the value of one of the variables, the project is
automatically recomputed, and the list of source files or directories
is changed dynamically to reflect the new status of the
project. Starting a new compilation at that point will use the new
switches, and all the aspects of GPS are immediately affected
according to the new setup.

@noindent
These windows give access to the various scripting languages supported
by GPS, and allow you to type commands such as editing a file or
compiling without using the menu items or the mouse.

@ifset python
Some of these windows, especially the python window, might not be
visible in your version of GPS, if GPS wasn't compiled with the
support for that specific scripting language.
@end ifset

See @ref{Scripting GPS} for more information on using
scripting languages within GPS.

@node The Locations Tree
@section The Locations Tree
@cindex location
@cindex locations tree
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@cindex search

The Location Tree is filled whenever GPS needs to display a list of
locations in the source files (typically, when performing a global
search, compilation results, and so on).

@iftex
@cindex screen shot
@image{locations-view, 11.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@cindex screen shot
@image{locations-view, 12.7cm}
@end ifhtml

@cindex category
@cindex file
The Location Tree shows a hierarchy of categories, which contain
files, which contain locations. Clicking on a location item will bring
up a file editor at the requested place. Right-clicking on file or
category items brings up a contextual menu allowing you to remove the
corresponding node from the view.

Every time a new category is created, as a result of a compilation or a
search operation for instance, the first entry of that category is
automatically selected, and the corresponding editor opened. This behavior
can be controlled through a preference @code{Jump To First Location}.

@cindex key
@cindex menu
To navigate through the next and previous location (also called @code{Tag}),
you can use the menu items @code{Navigate->Previous Tag} and
@code{Navigate->Next Tag}, or the corresponding key bindings.

In some cases, a wrench icon will be associated on the left of a compilation
message. See @ref{Code Fixing} for more information on how to make advantage
of this icon.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node The Execution Window
@section The Execution Window
@cindex execution
@cindex execution window
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@cindex run
@noindent
Each time a program is launched using the menu @code{Build->Run}, a new
execution window is created to provide input and output for this program.

In order to allow post mortem analysis and copy/pasting, the execution
windows are not destroyed when the application terminates.

@cindex key
@cindex menu
To close an execution window, click on the cross icon on the top right corner
of the window, or use the menu @code{File->Close}, or the menu
@code{Window->Close} or the key binding @key{Ctrl-W}.

If you close the execution window while the application is still running,
a dialog window is displayed, asking whether you want to kill the application,
or to cancel the close operation.

@cindex status bar
@cindex progress bar
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
The status line is composed of two areas: on the left a status bar and
on the right one or several progress bars.

@cindex messages
The status bar is used to display temporary information about GPS
operations. Note that most of the information GPS displays can be found
in the @code{Messages} window.

@cindex build
The progress bars are used to display information about on going
operations such as builds, searches, or VCS commands. These tasks
operate in the background, and can be paused/resumed via a contextual
menu. This contextual menu is available by right-clicking on the
progress bars themselves or on the corresponding lines in the Task
Manager. See @ref{The Task Manager}

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node The Task Manager

@noindent
The Task Manager window lists all the currently running GPS operations
that run in the background, such as builds, searches or VCS commands.

For each of these tasks, the Task Manager shows the status of the
task, and the current progress. The execution of theses tasks can be
suspended using a contextual menu, brought up by right-clicking on a
line.

* The Help Menu::
* Adding New Help Files::
@end menu

@noindent
By default when you start GPS, the working area contains a help window
displaying HTML help files. On-line help for the GNAT tools is available
from the @code{Help} menu item.

Since HTML pages can contain lots of complex information, resizing the
help window can take some time, making the user interface less responsive.
It is therefore recommended to close the @code{Help} window
when not using it. You can reopen this window at any time using the
@code{Help} menu item.

For the best use of the integrated help, it is recommended to load small
HTML pages each time instead of long pages which will be slow to load and
display.

@node The Help Menu
@section The Help Menu
@noindent
The Help menu item provides the following entries:

@table @b
@item Contents
This opens a special HTML file that contains links for all the
documentation files currently registered in GPS, @xref{Adding New Help Files}.

@item Zoom in
Increase the size of the font used to display the help file.

@item Zoom out
Decrease the size of the font used to display the help file.

@item Open HTML file...
Open a file selection dialog to load an HTML file.

@item About
Display a dialog giving information about the versions of GPS and GNAT used:

@iftex
@cindex screen shot
@image{about, 8.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@cindex screen shot
@image{about}
@end ifhtml

@end table

This menu contains a number of additional entries, depending on what
documentation packages were installed on your system. See the next
section to see how to add new help files.

The help window also provides a contextual menu that gives the possibility
to copy the current selection to the clipboard.

@node Adding New Help Files
@section Adding New Help Files
@cindex gps_index.xml
@noindent
GPS will search for the help files in the list of directories set in
the environment variable @code{GPS_DOC_PATH} (a colon-separated list
of directories on Unix systems, or semicolon-separated list of
directories on Windows systems). If this variable is not set, the
default directory @code{<prefix>/doc/gps/html} is searched.  If the
file cannot be found in any of these directories, the corresponding
menu item will be disabled.

The environment variable @code{GPS_DOC_PATH} can either be set by each
user in his own environment, or can be set system-wide by modifying
the small wrapper script @file{gps} itself on Unix systems.

The specific list of files shown in the menus is set by reading the
index files in each of the directories in @code{GPS_DOC_PATH}. These
index files must be called @file{gps_index.xml}, and their format
can be see in the following example:

@smallexample
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<index>
   <file>
      <name>file.html</name>
      <descr>Tooltip text</descr>
      <category>name</category>
      <menu>/Help/item</menu>
   </file>
</index>
@end smallexample

There should be one @code{<file>} tag per help file. This tag contains
four children tags:

@table @b
@item name
This is the name of the file. It can be either an absolute file name,
or a file name relative to one of the directories in
@code{GPS_DOC_PATH}.

This name can contain a reference to a specific anchor in the html
file, using the standard HTML syntax.

@smallexample
  <name>file#anchor</name>
@end smallexample

@item descr
This is the description for this help file. It appears in a tool tip
for the menu item.

@item category
This is used in the @code{Help->Contents} menu to organize all the
documentation files.

@item menu
This is the full path to the menu. It behaves like a UNIX path, except
it reference the various menus, starting from the menu bar itself. The
first character of this path must be @code{"/"}. The last part of the
path is the name of the new menu item. If not set, no menu is
displayed for this file, although it will still appear in the
@code{Help->Contents} menu

@noindent
All the windows that are part of the GPS environment are under control
of what is commonly called a multiple document interface (MDI for
short). This is a common paradigm on windowing systems, where related
windows are put into a bigger window which is itself under control of
the system or the windows manager.

This means that, by default, no matter how many editors, browsers,
explorers,@dots{} windows you have opened, your system will still see only
one window (On Windows systems, the task bar shows only one
icon). However, you can organize the GPS windows exactly the way you
want, all inside the GPS main window.

@cindex iconify
For instance, you can choose to iconify some windows which are
temporarily useless to you; you can choose to put some windows on top
of others; you can resize all the windows to the size you want; and so
on.

This section will show the various capacities that GPS provides to
help you organize your workspace.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
At any time, there is only one selected window in GPS (the @b{active
window}). You can select a window either by clicking in its title bar,
which will then get a different color, or by selecting its name in the
menu @code{Window}.

Alternatively, windows can be selected with the keyboard. By default,
the selection key is @key{Alt-Tab}. When you press it, a temporary
dialog is popped-up on the screen, with the name of the window that
will be selected when the key is released. If you press the selection
key multiple times, this will iterate over all the windows currently
open in GPS.

This interactive selection dialog is associated with a filter,
displayed below the name of the selected window. If you maintain
@key{Alt} pressed while pressing other keys than @key{Tab}, this
will modify the current filter. From then on, pressing
@key{Alt-Tab} will only iterate through those windows that match
the filter.

The filter is matched by any window whose name contains the letter you
have typed. For instance, if you are currently editing the files
@file{unit1.adb} and @file{file.adb}, pressing @key{t} will only leave
@file{unit1.adb} selectable.

@cindex title bar
@noindent
Wherever the windows are displayed, they are always closed in the same
manner. In the right side of the title bar of the window, three small
buttons are displayed. The rightmost button is a cross. Clicking on
this button will close the window.

When a window is closed, the focus is given to the window of the same
part of the MDI (each of the docks or the middle area) that previously
had the focus. Therefore, if you simply open an editor as a result of
a cross-reference query, you can simply close that editor to go back
to where you were before.

@noindent
The MDI is initially split into three parts: one window to the left,
one to the bottom, and a bigger one that occupies the remaining space.

The first two will be discussed in @ref{Docked Windows}.
The third area is the one that provides the most flexibility:

@table @b

@item maximized windows
The windows in this area are initially maximized. This means that if
you have several windows, a notebook will be created, and only one
window will be visible at any given time. You select the window you want
to see by clicking on the appropriate tab.

Note that if there are a lot of windows, two small arrows will appear
on the right of the tabs. Clicking on these arrows will show the
remaining tabs.

@iftex

@image{mdi-scroll-tabs, 12.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@cindex screen shot

@end ifhtml

@cindex menu
You can go back to this maximized state in two ways: either select the
menu @code{Window->Maximize All}, or click on the middle button on the
right of the title bar of any window (this button shows two small
squares, and will toggle between maximized and unmaximized states.


@item unmaximized windows
@cindex unmaximized
@cindex menu
Instead of putting all the windows inside a notebook, GPS lets you
organize them freely when they are unmaximized. Select the menu
@code{Window->Unmaximize All}, or click again in the middle button on
the right of the title bar.

In this mode, the windows can be resized freely by clicking on the
border of any side or in one of their four corners, as usual on
windowing systems.

They can also be moved around. As a result, you can choose for
instance to display several windows side by side, or one on top of
the others.

To make it easier to get to these standard organizations, GPS provides
a few shortcuts through menus:
@cindex menu

@table @code
@item Window->Cascade
@cindex cascade
All the windows will be resized to the same size, and be moved one on
top of the other, so that the top and left sides of all windows are
visible. This way, you can easily select any window

@item Window->Tile Horizontally
@cindex title
All the windows are resized to the same dimensions, and are put side
by side, from left to right. No window will overlap any other.

@item Iconified windows
@cindex iconified
When the windows are unmaximized, you can also choose to temporarily
iconify some of them. This is done by clicking on the leftmost button
in the title bar (the one that shows a single line).

The window will then be resized so that only part of its title bar is
visible, and none of its actual contents. Icons can still be moved
around as you want, but they cannot be resized. You need to first
de-iconify the window, by clicking once again on the same button.

When de-iconified, a window will restore the size and position it had
before it was iconified.

@node Docked Windows
@section Docked Windows
@cindex docked
@cindex docked window
@cindex work space
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
As mentioned before, the GPS work space is initially split into three
windows. The one on the left and the one at the bottom are called
@b{docking area}.

They have a different behavior from the central area, since windows in
these areas are necessarily grouped into a notebook. Thus, only one of
them is visible at any given time, and you select the one you want to
see by clicking on its name in the tabs area.

GPS includes four such areas, one on each side of the main area. Some
visual objects will initially be displayed in one of these docking areas
instead of in the central one, like the project explorer, the message
window,@dots{} Although you cannot control this initial position, it is
possible to change it later on (@ref{Moving Windows}).

However, you can still choose precisely the dimension you want for
this docking area (either its width for the left and right areas, or
its height for the top and bottom ones).

@cindex handle
Between each docking area and the central one, there is a small handle
(on which a series of dots are drawn), that you can move interactively
with the mouse, to resize the docking areas). By default, when you move
such a handle, a line will appear on top of all other windows in GPS to
show you the new position the docking area will have when you release
the mouse. You can set up a preference (menu @code{Edit->Preferences})
to indicate that you want the resizing to be opaque, that is that you
want to see the windows as you resize them.
@cindex preferences

Note that when a window is @b{docked} (i.e. put in a docking area), some
of the buttons in its title bar are grayed out and inactive.

@cindex menu
A simple way to dock a window is to select it, and then select the
menu @code{Window->Docked}. We will see in @ref{Moving Windows} that
there is a more intuitive way to do the same thing.

In some cases GPS will change the color and size of the title (name) of a
window in the notebook tab. This indicates that the window content
has been updated, but the window wasn't visible. Typically,
this is used to indicate that new messages have been written in the
messages or console window.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Splitting Windows
@section Splitting Windows
@cindex Splitting
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
The window in the central area of the MDI can be split at will, through
any combination of horizontal and vertical splits.
This feature requires at least two windows (text editors, browsers,...)
to be superimposed in the central area. Selecting either the
@code{Window->Split Horizontally} or @code{Window->Split Vertically} menus
will then split the selected window in two. In the left (resp. top) pane,
the currently selected window will be left on its own. The rest of the
previously superimposed windows will be put in the right (resp. bottom)
pane. You can then in turn split these remaining windows to achieve any
layout you want.

All split windows can be resized interactively by dragging the handles that
separate them, just as is done for docked windows. A preference (menu
@code{Edit->Preferences} controls whether this resizing is done in opaque
mode or border mode. In the latter case, only the new handle position will
be displayed while the mouse is dragged.

The current layout is lost when you select one of the menus
@code{Window->Cascade}, @code{Window->Tile Horizontally},
@code{Window->Tile Vertically} or @code{Window->Unmaximized}. It is also
changed if you destroy the last visible window in a pane. For instance, if
you have split the central area in two, with one editor only on each side,
closing any editor will result in an unsplit central area.

You may want to bind the key shortcuts to the menus
@code{Window->Split Horizontally}
as well as @code{Window->Split Vertically} using either the preference
@code{Dynamic Key Binding}, or the key manager. In addition, if you want to
achieve an effect similar to e.g. the standard Emacs behavior (where
@key{control-x 2} splits a window horizontally, and @key{control-x 3} splits
a window vertically), you can use the key manager
(@pxref{The Key Manager Dialog}).

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Floating Windows
@section Floating Windows
@cindex floating
@cindex top level
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
Although the MDI, as described so far, is already extremely flexible,
it is possible that you prefer to have several top-level windows under
direct control of your system or window manager. This would be the
case for instance if you want to benefit from some extra possibilities
that your system might provide (virtual desktops, different window
decoration depending on the window's type, transparent windows,@dots{}).

GPS is fully compatible with this behavior, since windows can also be
@b{floating windows}. Any window that is currently embedded in the MDI
can be made floating at any time, simply by selecting the window and
then selecting the menu @code{Window->Floating}. The window will then
be detached, and can be moved anywhere on your screen, even outside of
GPS's main window.

@cindex menu
There are two ways to put a floating window back under control of GPS.
The more general method is to select the window through its title in
the menu @code{Window}, and then unselect @code{Window->Floating}.

@cindex preferences
The second method assumes that the preference @b{Destroy Floats} in
the menu @code{Edit->Preferences} has been set to false. Then, you can
simply close the floating window by clicking in the appropriate title
bar button, and the window will be put back in GPS. If you actually
want to close it, you need to click once again on the cross button in
its title bar.

@cindex all floating
A special mode is also available in GPS, where all windows are
floating. The MDI area in the main window becomes invisible. This can be
useful if you rely on windows handling facilities supported by your
system or window manager but not available in GPS. This might also be
useful if you want to have windows on various virtual desktops, should
your window manager support this.

This special mode is activated through a preference (menu
@code{Edit->Preferences}). This preference is entitled @b{All
Floating}.

@cindex maximized
@cindex unmaximized
@cindex floating
@noindent
As we have seen, the windows' state can be changed at any time, from
maximized to unmaximized to docked to floating and back, in any
order.

@cindex menu
In all cases, the changes are done either through the buttons in the
title bar or through the @code{Window} menu.

@cindex drag-n-drop
A more intuitive method is also provided, based on
the drag-and-drop paradigm. The idea is simply to select a window,
wherever it is, and then, by clicking on it and moving the mouse while
keeping the left button pressed, drop it anywhere else inside GPS.

Selecting an item so that it can be dragged is done simply by clicking
with the left mouse button in its title bar, and keep the button
pressed while moving the mouse. Although this is the general scheme,
this would not work for unmaximized items, since the title bar is then
used to move them around. In that case, you need to press the
@key{control} key in addition to the left mouse button.

A third possibility can be used for maximized or docked windows: click
with the left mouse button in the notebook tab that contains their
name. This third option is not available under Microsoft Windows systems.

While you keep the mouse button pressed, and move the mouse around, the
selected drop area is highlighted with a dashed border. This shows precisely
where the window would be put if you were to release the mouse button at
that point.

Here are the various places where a window can be dropped:

@table @b
@item The central area
@cindex central area
If the windows in that area are unmaximized, the window you are dropping
(the current window) will acquire the same state. However, if the windows are
currently maximized in the central area, or even if the latter was split
horizontally, vertically or any combination of these, the location of the
current window is indicated by the dashed rectangle: either in the pane
where you released the mouse button, or on one of the sides of that pane
(splitting as needed).

@item Docking areas
@cindex docked
@cindex docking area
The window will be immediately added to this area after dropping it
and a new notebook will be created as needed.

In some cases, you might want to create a docking area that is not
currently visible (for instance, it is often useful to put the location window
in the right docking area).

To achieve this, drop the window on the small handle that surrounds
the whole GPS window (a black rectangle will appear on the screen when
your mouse is over that area). If you then drop the item, a new
docking area will be created.

@item System window
If you drop a window outside of GPS (for
instance, on the background of your screen), the window will be floated.

@end table


If you maintain the @key{shift} key pressed while dropping the window,
this might result in a copy operation instead of a simple move. For instance,
if you are dropping an editor, a new view of the same editor will be created,
resulting in two views present in GPS: the original one is left at its initial
location, and a second view is created at the new location.

Source editing is one of the central parts of GPS, giving in turn access
to many other functionalities, including extended source navigation and
source analyzing tools.

@iftex
@cindex screen shot
@image{source-editor, 12.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@cindex screen shot
@image{source-editor}
@end ifhtml

The integrated source editor provides all the usual capabilities found in
integrated environments, including:

@table @b
@item A title bar
Showing the full name of the file including path information.

@item Line number information
This is the left area of the source editor. Line numbers can be disabled
from the preferences. @xref{The Preferences Dialog}.
Note that this area can also display additional information, such as
the current line of execution when debugging, or cvs annotations.

@item A scrollbar
Located on the right of the editor, it allows you to scroll through the source
file.

@item A status bar
Giving information about the file.
If the file is maintained under version control, and version control is
supported and enabled in GPS, the first box on the left will show VCS
information on the file: the VCS kind (e.g. @i{CVS}), followed by the revision
number, and if available, the status of the file.

The second box shows the writable state of the file.
You can change this state by clicking on the label directly: this will
switch between @i{writable} and @i{read-only}.
Note that this will not change the permissions of the file on disk, it will
only change the writable state of the source editor within GPS.

When trying to save a file which is read only on the disk, GPS will ask for
confirmation, and if possible, will force saving of the file, keeping its read
only state.

The third box shows whether the file has been modified since the last
save. The three possible states are:

@table @i
@item Unmodified
The file has not been modified since the file has been loaded or saved.

@item Modified
The file has been modified since last load or save. Note that if you undo all
the editing operations until the last save operation, this label will change
to @i{Unmodified}.

@item Saved
The file has been saved and not modified since.

@end table

The fourth box displays the position of the cursor in the file by a line and
a column number.

@item A contextual menu
Displayed when you right-click on any area of the source editor.
See in particular @ref{Contextual Menus for Source Navigation}
for more details.

@item Syntax highlighting
Based on the programming language associated with the file, reserved words
and languages constructs such as comments and strings are highlighted in
different colors and fonts. See @ref{The Preferences Dialog} for a list of
settings that can be customized.

@item Automatic indentation
@cindex indentation
When enabled, lines are automatically indented each time you press the
@key{Enter} key, or by pressing the indentation key.
The indentation key is @key{Ctrl-Tab} by default, and can be changed in the
key manager dialog, @xref{The Key Manager Dialog}.

If a set of lines is selected when you press the indentation key, this whole
set of lines will be indented.

@item Tooltips
@cindex tooltip
When you leave the mouse over a word in the source editor, a small window
will automatically pop up if there are relevant contextual information to
display about the word.

The type of information displayed depends on the current state of GPS.

In normal mode, the entity kind and the location of declaration is
displayed when this information is available. That is, when the
cross-reference information about the current file has been
generated. If there is no relevant information, no tooltip is displayed.
See @ref{Support for Cross-References} for more information.

In debugging mode, the value of the variable under the mouse is displayed in
the pop up window if the variable is known to the debugger.
Otherwise, the normal mode information is displayed.

You can disable the automatic pop up of tool tips in the Editor section of
the preferences dialog. @xref{The Preferences Dialog}.

@item Word completion
@cindex completion
It is useful when editing a file and using often the same words to get
automatic word completion. This is possible by typing the @key{Ctrl-/} key
combination (customizable through the key manager dialog) after a partial
word: the next possible completion will be inserted in the editor. Typing this
key again will cycle through the list of possible completions.

Completions are searched in the edited source file, by first looking at the
closest words and then looking further in the source as needed.

@item Delimiter highlighting
@cindex delimiter
When the cursor is moved before an opening delimiter or after a closing
delimiter, then both delimiters will be highlighted. The following characters
are considered delimiters: ()[]@{@}.
You can disable highlighting of delimiters in the preferences.

You can also jump to a corresponding delimiter by using the @key{Ctrl-'} key,
that can be configured in the preferences. Typing twice on this key will move
the cursor back to its original position.

@item Current line highlighting
@cindex current line
You can configure the editor to highlight the current line with a certain
color. @xref{The Preferences Dialog}.

@item Current block highlighting
@cindex block
If this preference is enabled, the editor will highlight the current block
of code, e.g. the current @code{begin...end} block, or loop statement,
etc@dots{}

The block highlighting will also take into account the changes made in
your source code, and will recompute automatically the current block when
needed.

This capability is currently implemented for Ada, C and C++ languages.

@item Block folding
@cindex block
When enabled, the editor will display @code{-} icons on the left side,
corresponding to the beginning of subprograms. If you click on one of these
icons, all the lines corresponding to this subprogram are hidden, except
the first one. As for the block highlighting, these icons are recomputed
automatically when you modify your sources and are always kept up to date.

This capability is currently implemented for Ada, C and C++ languages.

@item Auto save
@cindex auto save
You can configure the editor to periodically save modified files.
See @ref{autosave delay} for a full description of this capability.

@noindent
In addition to the standard keys used to navigate in the editor (up, down,
right, left, page up, page down), the integrated editor provides a number of
key bindings allowing easy navigation in the file.

The key bindings are listed below in two sections: the common key bindings,
always available; the Emacs key bindings, available as an option.

In addition, there are several ways to define new key bindings, see
@ref{Defining Text Aliases} and @ref{Defining new key bindings}.

@item A list with the current directory and the last directories explored.
You can modify the current directory by modifying the text entry and hitting
@key{Enter}, or by clicking on the right arrow and choose a previous directory
in the pop down list displayed.

@item A directory tree. You can open or close directories by clicking on the
@code{+} and @code{-} icons on the left of the directories, or
navigate using the keyboard keys: @key{up} and @key{down} to select the
previous or the next directory, @key{+} and @key{-} to expand and collapse
the current directory, and @key{backspace} to select the parent directory.

@item A file list. This area lists the files contained in the selected
directory. If a filter is selected in the filter area, only the relevant
files for the given filter are displayed. Depending on the context, the
list of files may include additional information about the files, e.g. the
kind of a file, its size, etc@dots{}

@item A filter area. Depending on the context, one or several filters are
available to select only a subset of files to display. The filter
@i{All files} which is always available will display all files in the

@noindent

@table @b
@item New
@cindex new file
Open a new untitled source editor.
No syntax highlighting is performed until the file is saved, since GPS needs
to know the file name in order to choose the programming language associated
with a file.

@cindex Ada
When you save a new file for the first time, GPS will ask you to enter the
name of the file. In case you have started typing Ada code, GPS will try
to guess based on the first main entity in the editor and on the current
naming scheme, what should be the default name of this new file.

@item New View
@cindex new view
@cindex view
Create a new view of the current editor. The new view shares the same
contents: if you modify one of the source views, the other view is updated
at the same time. This is particularly useful when you want to display two
separate parts of the same file, for example a function spec and its body.

A new view can also be created by keeping the @key{shift} key pressed while
drag-and-dropping the editor (see @ref{Moving Windows}). This second method is
preferred, since you can then specify directly where you want to put the new
view. The default when using the menu is that the new view is put on top of
the editor itself.

@item Open...
@cindex open
@cindex Windows

The first text area allows you to type a file name. You can start the beginning
of a file name, and use the @key{Tab} key to complete the file name. If there
are several possible completions, the common prefix will be displayed, and
a list of all possible completions will be displayed in the second text area.

@cindex key
You can then either complete the name by typing it, or continue hitting the
@key{Tab} key to cycle through the possible completions, or click on one of the
completions in the list displayed.

If you press the down arrow key, the focus will move to the list of
completions, so that you can select a file from this list without using the
mouse.

Once you have made your choice, click on the @code{OK} button to validate.
Clicking on @code{Cancel} or hitting the @key{Esc} key will cancel the
operation and close the dialog.

This dialog will only show each file once. If you have extended
projects in your hierarchy, some files may be redefined in some
extending project. In this case, only the files from the extending
project are shown, and you cannot have access through this dialog to
the overridden files of the extended project. Of course, you can still
use the project explorer or the standard @code{File->Open} menu to
open these files.

print dialog box is displayed. This dialog box allows the user to specify the
target printer, the properties of the printer, which pages to print (all, or a
specific range of pages), the number of copies to print, and, when more than
one copy is specified, whether the pages should be collated.  Pressing the
Cancel button on the dialog box returns to GPS without printing the window
contents; otherwise the specified pages and copies are printed on the selected
printer. Each page is printed with a header containing the name of the file
(if the window has ever been saved). The page number is printed on the bottom

@noindent
GPS is fully integrated with a number of external editors, in
particular @code{Emacs} and @code{vi}. The choice of the default
external editor is done in the preferences. @xref{The Preferences Dialog}.
@cindex preferences
The following values are recognized:

@table @code
@item gnuclient
@cindex gnuclient
This is the recommended client. It is based on Emacs, but needs an
extra package to be installed. This is the only client that provides a
full integration in GPS, since any extended lisp command can be sent
to the Emacs server.

By default, gnuclient will open a new Emacs frame for every file
that is opened. You might want to add the following code to your
@file{.emacs} file (create one if needed) so that the same Emacs frame
is reused every time:

@cindex example
@smallexample
   (setq gnuserv-frame (car (frame-list)))
@end smallexample

@cindex url
See @url{http://www.hpl.hp.co.uk/people/ange/gnuserv/} for more information.

@item emacsclient
@cindex emacsclient
This is a program that is always available if you have installed
Emacs. As opposed to starting a new Emacs every time, it will reuse an
existing Emacs session. It is then extremely fast to open a file.


@item emacs
@cindex emacs
This client will start a new Emacs session every time a file needs to
be opened. You should use @code{emacsclient} instead, since it is much
faster, and makes it easier to copy and paste between multiple
files. Basically, the only reason to use this external editor is if
your system doesn't support @code{emacsclient}.


@item vim
@cindex vim
@code{Vim} is a vi-like editor that provides a number of enhancements,
for instance syntax highlighting for all the languages supported by
GPS. Selecting this external editor will start an xterm (or command
window, depending on your system) with a running @code{vim} process editing
the file.

Note that one limitation of this editor is that if GPS needs to open
the same file a second time, it will open a new editor, instead of
reusing the existing one.

@cindex Windows
To enable this capability, the xterm executable must be found in the PATH,
and thus is not supported on Windows systems. Under Windows systems,
you can use the @code{custom} editor instead.


@item vi
@cindex vi
This editor works exactly like vim, but uses the standard @code{vi}
command instead of @code{vim}.


@item custom
@cindex custom editor
You can specify any external editor by choosing this item. The full
command line used to call the editor can be specified in the
preferences (see @ref{custom editor command}).

@item none
No external editor is used, and the contextual menus simply won't
appear.
@end table


In the cases that require an Emacs server, GPS will try several
solutions if no already running server was found. It will first try to
spawn the glide environment distributed with GNAT. If not found in the
PATH, it will then start a standard Emacs. The project file currently used
in GPS will be set appropriately the first time Emacs is spawned. This means
that if you load a new project in GPS, or modify the paths of the current
project, you should kill any running Emacs, so that a new one is spawned
by GPS with the appropriate project.

@cindex menu
Alternatively, you can reload explicitly the project from
Emacs itself by using the menu @code{Project->Load}


@cindex preferences
In the preferences, there are three settings that allow you to select
the external editor (if left to an empty string, GPS will
automatically select the first editor available on your system), to
specify the custom editor command, in case you've selector this item, and
whether this editor should always be used every time you double-click
on a file, or whether you need to explicitly select the contextual
menu to open the external editor.

@noindent
This section concerns X-Window users who are used to cutting and
pasting with the middle mouse button. In the GPS text editor, as in
many recent X applications, the @i{GPS clipboard} is set by explicit
cut/copy/paste actions, either through menu items or keyboard
shortcuts, and the @i{primary clipboard} (i.e. the ``middle button''
clipboard) is set by the current selection.

Therefore, copy/paste between GPS and other X applications using the
@i{primary clipboard} will still work, provided that there is some
text currently selected. The @i{GPS clipboard}, when set, will
override the @i{primary clipboard}.

@node Saving Files
@section Saving Files
@cindex saving
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
After you have finished modifying your files, you need to save them. The basic
method to do that is to select the menu @code{File->Save}, which saves the
currently selected file.

You can also use the menu @code{File->Save As...} if you want to save the
file with another name, or in another directory.

If you have multiple files to save, another possibility is to use the menu
@code{File->Save More->All}. This will open a dialog listing all the currently
modified editors that need saving. You can then select individually which
one should be saved, and click on @code{Save} to do the actual saving.

When calling external commands, such as compiling a file, if the
@code{Auto save} preference is disabled, this same dialog is also used,
to make sure that e.g. the compiler will take into account your local changes.
If the preference is enabled, the saving is performed automatically.

@iftex
@cindex screen shot
@image{save-dialog, 10cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml

@end ifhtml

You can conveniently select or unselect all the files at once by clicking on
the title of the first column (labelled @i{Select}). This will toggle
the selection status of the first line, and have the same status for all other
editors.

If you press @code{Cancel} instead of @code{OK}, no saving will take place,
and the action that displayed this dialog is also cancelled. Such actions can
be for instance starting a compilation command, a VCS operation, or quitting
GPS with unsaved files.

@node Remote Files
@section Remote Files
@cindex remote files
@cindex ftp
@cindex ssh
@cindex rsh
@cindex rsync
@cindex telnet
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
GPS has a basic support for working with files on remote hosts. This includes
a number of protocols, described below, which allow you to read a file from
a remote host, edit it locally, and then save it transparently to the remote
machine.

For now, the support for remote files is only available through the GPS
shell window. You start editing a remote file by typing a line similar to

@smallexample
edit protocol://user@@machine/full/path
@end smallexample

where "protocol" should be replaced by the name of the protocol you want to
use, "user" is the login name you wish to use on the remote "machine", and
"/full/path" is the full path on the remote machine to access the file.

The user name is optional. If it is the same as on the local machine, you
can omit the user name as well as the "@@" sign.

Likewise, the machine name is optional, if you want to get a file from the
local host. This can be used to access files belonging to another user. In this
case, you need to specify the "@@" sign, but do not insert a machine name right
after it.

Remote files can also be used if you want to work with GPS, but the machine on
which the files are found isn't supported by GPS.

The following protocols are supported:

@table @b
@item ssh
This protocol is based on the ssh command line tool, which must therefore be
available in the path. It provides encrypted and secure connections to the
remote host. Files are transfered inline, that is the connection is established
the first time you access the remote host, and kept open for all further
access.

Although ssh can be setup not to require a password, GPS will automatically
detect if a password is asked and open a dialog to query it.

The remote system must be a Unix-like system with support for standard Unix
commands like @code{test}, @code{echo}, @code{rm} and @code{ls}.

In the sample shell command above, you would replace the word "protocol" with
"ssh" to use this protocol.

@item rsh
This protocol behaves like ssh, except that the connections are not encpryted.
However, this protocol is generally available on all Unix machines by default.

It has the same requirements that the ssh protocol. To use it, substitute the
word "rsh" to "protocol" in the example above.

@item telnet
This protocol is based on the standard telnet protocol. It behaves much like
the two protocols above, with an unencrypted connection.

To use it, substitute the word "telnet" to "protocol" in the example above.

@item scp
This protocol is also based on one of the tools of the ssh suite. It provides
encrypted connections, and uses a mixture of ssh and scp connections.
Various commands like querying the timestamp of a file are executed through a
permanent ssh connection, whereas files are downloaded and uploaded through
a one-time scp command.

It basically has the same behavior as the ssh protocol, although it might be
slightly slower since a new connection has to be established every time a file
is fetched from, or written to the remote host. However, it might work better
than ssh if the file contains 8 bit characters.

To use it, substitute the word "scp" to "protocol" in the example above.

@item rsync
Just like scp is based on ssh, this protocol is based on rsh. It depends on
the external tool rsync, and uses a mixture of a rsh connection for commands
like querying the timestamp of a file, and one-time connections with rsync
to transfer the files.

Rsync is specially optimized to transfer only the parts of a file that are
different from the one already on the remote host. Therefore, it will generally
provide the best performance when writing the file back to the remote host.

If you set up the environment variable RSYNC_RSH to ssh before starting gps,
the connection will then be encrypted when transfering the files.

To use this protocol, substitute the word "rsync" to "protocol" in the
example above.

@item ftp
This protocol provides only limited capabilities, but can be used to retrieve
or write a file back through an ftp connection, possibly even through an
anonymous ftp connection.

To use this protocol, substitute the word "ftp" to "protocol" in the example
above.

@section Support for Cross-References
@cindex cross-references
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
GPS provides cross-reference navigation for program entities, such as
types, procedures, functions, variables, @dots{}, defined in your
application. The cross-reference support in GPS relies on
language-specific tools as explained below.

@table @b
@item Ada
@cindex Ada
@cindex GNAT
The GNAT compiler is used to generate the cross-references information
needed by GPS. This means that you must compile your application before
you browse through the cross-references or view various graphs in GPS.
If sources have been modified, you should recompile the modified files.

@cindex -gnatQ
@cindex -k
If you need to navigate through sources that do not compile (e.g after
modifications, or while porting an application), GNAT can still generate
partial cross-reference information if you specify the @code{-gnatQ}
compilation option. Along with the @code{-k} option of gnatmake, it is
then possible to generate as much relevant information as possible for
your non compilable sources.

@cindex ALI
There are a few special cases where GPS cannot find the external file
(called @file{ALI file}) that contains the cross-reference
information. Most likely, this is either because you haven't compiled
your sources yet, or because the source code has changed since the
@file{ALI file} was generated.

@cindex project
It could also be that you haven't included in the project the object
directories that contain the @file{ALI files}.

@cindex separate unit
In addition, one special case cannot be handled automatically. This
is for separate units, whose file names have been crunched through the
@command{gnatkr} command. To handle this, you should force GPS to parse
all the @file{ALI files} in the appropriate object directory. This is
done by right-clicking on the object directory in the explorer
(left-side panel on the main window), and selecting the menu "Parse
all xref information".

@item C/C++
@cindex C
@cindex C++
To enable the navigation features for C and C++ source files, you need
to first generate a database of symbol references, by going through the
menu Build->Recompute C/C++ Xref info. Messages in the console window
will indicate the state of the processing. Due to the nature of these
languages, in order to provide accurate cross-references, GPS needs to
generate the database in two phases: a first pass parses all the files
that have been modified since the previous parsing, and a second pass
generates global cross-references by analyzing the complete database.
It is thus expected that for large projects, this phase can take a
significant amount of CPU to proceed.

@cindex overloaded
@cindex #ifdef
In some cases, GPS won't be able to determine the exact function involved
in a cross-reference. This will typically occur for overloaded functions,
or if multiple functions with the same name, but under different
@code{#ifdef} sections, are defined. In this case, GPS will display a
dialog listing the possible choices to resolve the ambiguity.

@cindex namespace
@cindex macro
In addition, the C/C++ parser has the following limitations: namespaces
are currently ignored (no specific processing is done for namespaces);
no attempt is made to process the macros and other preprocessor defines.
Macros are considered as special entities, so it is possible to navigate
from a macro use to its definition, but the macro content is ignored,
which means for example that function calls made through macros
won't be detected.

@subsection Project files and GNAT tools
@cindex project file
@cindex GNAT

@noindent
This section describes what the projects are, and what information
they contain.

The most important thing to note is that the projects used by GPS are
the same as the ones used by GNAT. These are text files (using the
extension @file{.gpr}) which can be edited either manually, with any
text editor, or through the more advanced GPS interface.

The exact syntax of the project files is fully described in the GNAT
User's Guide (@url{gnat_ug.html}) and GNAT Reference Manual
(@url{gnat_rm.html}). This is recommended reading if you want to use
some of the more advanced capabilities of project files which are not
yet supported by the graphical interface.

GPS can load any project file, even those that you have been
edited manually. Furthermore, you can manually edit project files
created by GPS.

Typically you will not need to edit project files manually, since several
graphical tools such as the project wizard (@ref{The Project Wizard})
and the properties editor(@ref{The Project Properties Editor}) are
provided.

@c The english of the following paragraph is unclear
@c
@cindex normalization of projects
GPS doesn't preserve the layout of whole content of manually created
project after you have edited them in GPS. For instance, comments are
not currently preserved. Likewise, multiple case statements in the
project will be coalesced into a single case statement. This
normalization is required for GPS to be able to preserve the previous
semantic of the project in addition to the new settings.


@cindex GNAT
All command-line GNAT tools are project aware, meaning that the notion
of project goes well beyond GPS' user interface. Most capabilities
of project files can be accessed without using GPS itself, making
project files very attractive.

@cindex Ada
@cindex gpr2make
If you are using programming languages other than Ada, the project
files can automatically generate Makefiles through the @file{gpr2make}
tool provided with GNAT. Round trip editing is not available though,
and any change you make to the generated Makefiles will be lost the
next time the tool is run.

@cindex ADA_PROJECT_PATH
GPS uses the same mechanisms to locate project files as GNAT
itself:

@itemize @bullet
@item absolute paths
@item relative paths.
These paths, when used in a with line as described below, are relative
to the location of the project that does the with.
@item ADA_PROJECT_PATH.
If this environment variable is set, it contains a colon-separated (or
semicolon under Windows) list of directories in which the project files are
searched.
@end itemize


@subsection Contents of project files
@cindex project file

@noindent
Project files contain all the information that describe the
organization of your source files, object files and executables.

@cindex sub project
Generally, one project file will not be enough to describe a complex
organization. In this case, you will create and use a project hierarchy,
with a root project importing other sub projects. Each of the projects
and sub projects is responsible for its own set of sources (compiling
them with the appropriate switches, put the resulting files in the
right directories, @dots{}).

@cindex GNAT
Each project contains the following information
(see the GNAT user's guide for the full list)

@itemize @bullet
@item @b{List of imported projects}:
@cindex imported project
   When you are compiling sources from this project, the compiler
   (either through GNAT or the automatically generated Makefiles) will
   first make sure that all the imported projects have been correctly
   recompiled and are up-to-date. This way, dependencies between
   source files are properly handled.

   If one of the source files of project A depends on some source
   files from project B, then B must be imported by A. If this isn't
   the case, the compiler will complain that some of the source files
   cannot be found.

   One important rule is that each source file name must be unique in
   the project hierarchy (i.e. a file cannot be under control of two
   different projects). This ensures that the same file will be found
   no matter what project is managing the source file that uses

@item @b{List of source directories}:
@cindex source directory
   All the sources managed by a project are found in one or more
   source directories. Each project can have multiple source
   directories, and a given source directory might be shared by
   multiple projects.

@item @b{Object directory}:
@cindex object directory
   When the sources of the project are compiled, the resulting object
   files are put into this object directory. There exist exactly one object
   directory for each project. If you need to split the object files
   among multiple object directories, you need to create multiple
   projects importing one another as appropriate.

   When sources from imported sub-projects are recompiled, the
   resulting object files are put in the sub project's own object
   directory, and will never pollute the parent's object directory.

@item @b{Exec directory}:
@cindex exec directory
   When a set of object files is linked into an executable, this executable
   is put in the exec directory of the project file. If this attribute
   is unspecified, the object directory is used.

@item @b{List of source files}:
@cindex source file
   The project is responsible for managing a set of source
   files. These files can be written in any programming
   languages. Currently, the graphical interface supports Ada, C and C++.

   The default to find this set of source files is to take all the
   files in the source directories that follow the naming scheme (see
   below) for each language. In addition if you edit the
   project file manually, it is possible to provide an explicit list of source
   files.

   This attribute cannot be modified graphically yet.

@item @b{List of main units}:
@cindex main unit
   The main units of a project (or main files in some languages) are
   the units that contain the main subprogram of the application, and
   that can be used to link the rest of the application.

   The name of the file is generally related to the name of the
   executable.

   A given project file hierarchy can be used to compile and link
   several executables. GPS will automatically update the Compile, Run
   and Debug menu with the list of executables, based on this list.

@item @b{Naming schemes}:
@cindex naming scheme
   The naming scheme refers to the way files are named for each
   languages of the project. This is used by GPS to choose the language
   support to use when a source file is opened. This is also used to
   know what tools should be used to compile or otherwise work with a
   source file.

@item @b{Embedded targets and cross environments}:
@cindex cross environment
   GPS supports cross environment software development: GPS itself can
   run on a given host, such as GNU/Linux, while compilations, runs and
   debugging occur on a different remote host, such as Sun/Solaris.

@cindex VxWorks
   GPS also supports embedded targets (VxWorks, @dots{}) by specifying
   alternate names for the build and debug tools.

   The project file contains the information required to log on the
   remote host.

@item @b{Tools}:
@cindex tools
   Project files provide a simple way to specify the compiler and
   debugger commands to use.

@item @b{Switches}:
@cindex switches
   Each tool that is used by GPS (compiler, pretty-printer, debugger,
   @dots{}) has its own set of switches. Moreover, these switches may
   depend on the specific file being processed, and the programming
   language it is written in.

@end itemize

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Supported Languages
@section Supported Languages
@cindex languages
@cindex text files
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
Another information stored in the project is the list of languages that
this project knows about. GPS support any number of language, with any name
you choose. However, advanced support is only provided by default for some
languages (Ada, C and C++), and you can specify other properties of the
languages through customization files
(@pxref{Adding Support for New Languages}).

By default, the graphical interface will only give you a choice of languages
among the ones that are known to GPS at that point, either through the default
GPS support or your customization files. But you can also edit the project
files by hand to add support for any language.

Languages are a very important part of the project definition. For each
language, you should specify a naming scheme that allows GPS to associate
files with that language. You would for instance specify that all @file{.adb}
files are Ada, all @file{.txt} files are standard text files, and so on.

Only the files that have a known language associated with them are displayed
in the @code{Project View}, or available for easy selection through the
@code{File->Open From Project} menu. Similarly, only these files are shown
in the Version Control System interface.

It is therefore important to properly setup your project to make these files
available conveniently in GPS, although of course you can still open any file
through the @code{File->Open} menu.

If your project includes some README files, or other text files, you should
add "txt" as a language (or any other name you want), and make sure that
these files are associated with that language in the @code{Project properties
editor}.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Scenarios and Configuration Variables
@section Scenarios and Configuration Variables
@cindex configuration variable
@cindex project variable
@cindex variable
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
The behavior of projects can be further tailored by the use of
scenarios.

@cindex project attribute
All the attributes of a project, except its list of imported projects,
can be chosen based on the value of external variables, whose value is
generally coming from the host computer environment, or directly set in
GPS (using the small area on top of the project explorer (@ref{The
Project Explorer}).

@cindex compile
@cindex debug
This facility can for instance be used to compile all the sources either
in debug mode (so that the executables can be run in the debugger), or
in optimized mode (to reduce the space and increase the speed when
delivering the software).  In this configuration scenario, all the
attributes (source directories, tools, @dots{}) remain the same, except
for the compilation switches. It would be more difficult to maintain a
completely separate hierarchy of project, and it is much more efficient
to create a new configuration variable and edit the switches for the
appropriate scenario (@ref{The Project Properties Editor}).


@subsection Creating new configuration variables
@cindex creating configuration variable

@noindent
Creating a new scenario variable is done through the contextual menu
(right-click) in the project explorer. Select the menu @code{Add
Configuration Variable}. This opens the following dialog:

@iftex
@cindex screen shot
@image{scenarios, 10cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@cindex screen shot
@image{scenarios}
@end ifhtml

There are two main areas in this dialog: in the top line, you specify
the name of the variable. This name is used for two purposes:

@itemize @bullet
@item It is displayed in the project explorer
@cindex project explorer

@item This is the name of the environment variable from which the
initial value is read. When GPS is started, all configuration
variables are initialized from the host computer environment, although
you can of course change its value later on inside GPS.

@end itemize

If you click on the arrow on the right of this name area, GPS will
display the list of all the environment variables that are currently
defined. However, you don't need to pick the name of an existing
variable, neither must the variable exist when GPS is started.

The second part of this dialog is the list of authorized value for
this variable. Any other value will generate an error reported by
GPS, and the project won't be loaded as a result.

One of these values is the default value (the one whose button in the
Default column is selected). This means that if the environment
variable doesn't exist when GPS is started, GPS will behave as if it
did exist with this default value.

The list of possible values can be edited through the @code{Remove},
@code{Add} and @code{Rename} buttons, although you can also simply
click on the value itself to change it.


@subsection Editing existing configuration variables
@cindex editing configuration variable

@noindent
If at least one configuration variable is defined in your project, the
area on top of the project explorer will contain something similar to:

@iftex
@cindex screen shot
@image{explorer-scenario, 8.5cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@cindex screen shot
@image{explorer-scenario}
@end ifhtml

@cindex Unix
This screen shot shows two configuration variables, named @code{Build}
and @code{OS}, with their current value (resp. @code{Debug} and
@code{Unix}).

You can easily change the current value of any of these variables by
clicking on the arrow on the right of the value. This will display a
pop-up window with the list of possible values, from which you select
the one you wish to use.

@cindex project explorer
As soon as a new value is selected, GPS will recompute the project
explorer (in case source directories, object directories or list
of source files have changed). A number of things will also be updated
(like the list of executables in the @code{Compile}, @code{Run} and
@code{Debug} menus).

@cindex browsers
@cindex call graph
Currently, GPS will not recompute the contents of the various browsers
(call graph, dependencies, @dots{}) for this updated project. This would be too
expensive to do every time the value changes, and therefore you need
to explicitly request an update.

@c ??? Need to explain how to force an update, once this is implemented

You can change the list of possible values for a configuration
variable at any time by clicking on the button to the far left of the
variable's name. This will pop up the same dialog that is used to create
new variables

@cindex removing variable
Removing a variable is done by clicking on the button immediately to
the left of the variable's name. GPS will then display a confirmation
dialog.

If you confirm that you want to delete the variable, GPS will simply
remove the variable, and from now on act as if the variable always had
the value it had when it was deleted.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node The Project Explorer (Editing Projects)
@section The Project Explorer
@cindex project explorer
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
The project explorer, as mentioned in the general description of the
GPS window, is one of the two explorers found by default on the left
of the window. It shows in a tree structure the project hierarchy,
along with all the source files belonging to the project, and the
entities declared in the source files.

It is worth noting that the explorer provides a tree representation of
the project hierarchy. If a project is imported by multiple other
projects in the hierarchy, then this project will appear multiple times
in the explorer.

@cindex limited with
Likewise, if you have edited the project manually and have used the
@code{limited with} construct to have cycles in the project
dependencies, the cycle will expand infinitely. For instance, if
project @file{a} imports project @file{b}, which in turns imports
project @file{a} through a @code{limited with} clause, then expanding
the node for @file{a} will show @file{b}. In turn, expanding the node
for @file{b} will show a node for @file{a}, and so on.

The contextual menu in this explorer provides a number of items to
modify the project hierarchy (what each project imports), as well as
to visualize and modify the attributes for each projects (compilation
switches, naming scheme, @dots{})

The following entries are available in the contextual menu:

@table @command
@item Show Projects Imported by...
This item will open a new window in GPS, the project browser, which
displays graphically the relationships between each project in the
hierarchy.

@item Save The Project...
@cindex saving projects
This item can be selected to save a single project in the hierarchy
after it was modified. Modified but unsaved projects in the hierarchy
have a special icon (a red exclamation mark is drawn on top of the
standard icon). If you would rather save all the modified projects in
a single step, use the menu bar item @code{Project->Save All}.

@item Edit Project Properties
This item will open a new dialog, and give access to all the
attributes of the project: tool switches, naming schemes, source
directories, @dots{} @xref{The Project Properties Editor}.

@item Add Dependency...
@cindex add dependency
This menu and its two sub-menus are the primary way to change the
relationship between projects in the hierarchy. You can either add a
dependency on an already existing project, or a dependency on a newly
created project.

@item Remove Dependency...
@cindex remove dependency
This menu item is the opposite of the previous one, and will remove a
dependency between two projects

@item Add Configuration Variable
@cindex add configuration variable
This menu item should be used to add new configuration variables, as
described in @ref{Scenarios and Configuration Variables}.

@item Edit Project Source File
@cindex edit project source file
This menu will load the project file into an editor, so that you can
manually edit it. This should be used if you need to access some
features of the project files that are not accessible graphically
(renames statements, variables, @dots{})

@end table

@cindex saving projects
Any time one or several projects are modified, the contents of the
explorer is automatically refreshed. No project is automatically
saved. This provides a simple way to temporarily test new values for
the project attributes.
Unsaved modified projects are shown with a special icon in the project
explorer, displaying a red exclamation mark on top of the standard
icon:

@iftex
@cindex screen shot
@image{project-modified}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@cindex screen shot
@image{project-modified}
@end ifhtml

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node The Project Menu
@section The Project Menu
@cindex project menu
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------

The menu bar item @code{Project} contains several commands that
generally act on the whole project hierarchy. If you only want to act
on a single project, use the contextual menu in the project explorer.

Some of these menus apply to the currently selected project. This
notion depends on what window is currently active in GPS: if it is the
project explorer, the selected project is either the selected node (if
it is a project), or its parent project (for a file, directory, @dots{}).
If the currently active window is an editor, the selected project is
the one that contains the file.

In all cases, if there is no currently selected project, the menu will
apply to the root project of the hierarchy.

These commands are:

@table @command
@item New
This menu will open the project wizard (@ref{The Project Wizard}), so
that you can create new project. On exit, the wizard asks whether the
newly created project should be loaded. If you select @code{Yes}, the new
project will replace the currently loaded project hierarchy.

@item Open
This menu opens a file selection dialog, so that any existing project
can be loaded into GPS. The newly loaded project replaces the currently
loaded project hierarchy. GPS works on a single project hierarchy at
a time.

@item Recent
This menu can be used to easily switch between the last projects that
were loaded in GPS.

@item Edit Project Properties
This menu applies to the currently selected project, and will open the
project properties dialog for this project.

@item Save All
This will save all the modified projects in the hierarchy.

@item Edit File Switches
This menu applies to the currently selected project. This will open a
new window in GPS, listing all the source files for this project,
along with the switches that will be used to compile them, @xref{The
Switches Editor}.

@item Recompute Project
@cindex recompute project
@cindex C
@cindex C++
Recompute the contents of the project after modifications outside of GPS. In
particular, it will take into account new files added externally to the source
directories.
This isn't needed for modifications made through GPS. Note also that
this doesn't re-parse the physical project file on disk. Instead, you can
reopen the project if you have done manual modifications to it.

@item File View and Project View
These two menus will open (or raise if they are already open) the
explorers on the left side of the GPS window.

@end table

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node The Project Wizard
@section The Project Wizard
@cindex project wizard
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
The project wizard allows you to create in a few steps a new project file.
It has a number of pages, each dedicated to editing a specific set of
attributes for the project.

The typical way to access this wizard is through the
@code{Project->New...} menu. On exit, the wizard will ask whether the newly
created project should replace the currently loaded ones.

The project wizard is also launched when a new dependency is created
between two projects, through the contextual menu in the project
explorer.

@iftex
@cindex screen shot
@image{project-wizard, 12.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@cindex screen shot
@image{project-wizard}
@end ifhtml

The wizard gives access to the following list of pages:

@itemize @bullet
@item Project Naming
@item VCS Selection
@item Source Directories Selection
@item Build Directory
@item Naming Scheme
@item Main Units
@item Switches
@end itemize

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------
@subsection Project Naming
@c ------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
This is the first page displayed by the wizard.

You must enter the name and location of the project to create. This
name must be a valid Ada identifier (i.e. start with a letter,
optionally followed by a series of digits, letters or
underscores). Spaces are not allowed. Likewise, reserved Ada keywords
must be avoided. If the name is invalid, GPS will display an error
message when you press the @code{Forward} button.

Child projects can be created from this dialog. These are project whose
name is of the form @code{Parent.Child}. However, the generated project
is invalid, since one of the restrictions for these projects, which is
currently not enforced by GPS, is that the project must import or
extend its parent project. Therefore, you will not be able to
load this project in GPS until you have manually edited it.

In this page, you should also select what languages the source files
in this project are written in. Currently supported languages are @code{Ada},
@code{C} and @code{C++}. Multiple languages can be used for a single
project.

The last part of this page is used to indicate how the path should be
stored in the generated project file. Most of the time, this setting
will have no impact on your work. However, if you wish to edit the
project files by hand, or be able to duplicate a project hierarchy to
another location on your disk, it might be useful to indicate that
paths should be stored as relative paths (they will be relative to the
location of the project file).

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------
@subsection VCS Selection
@cindex Version Control System
@cindex VCS
@c ------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
The second page in the project wizard allows you to select which Version
Control system is to be used for the source files of this project.

GPS doesn't attempt to automatically guess what it should use, so you
must specify it if you want the VCS operations to be available to you.

The two actions @code{Log checker} and @code{File checker} are the
name and location of programs to be run just prior an actual commit of
the files in the Version Control System. These should be used for
instance if you wish to enforce style checks before a file is actually
made available to other developers in your team.

If left blank, no program will be run.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------
@subsection Source Directories Selection
@c ------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
This page lists and edits the list of source directories for the
project. Any number of source directory can be used (the default is to
use the directory which contains the project file, as
specified in the first page of the wizard).

If you do not specify any source directory, no source file will be
associated with the project, since GPS wouldn't know where to look for
them.

To add source directories to the project, select a directory in the
top frame, and click on the down arrow. This will add the directory to
the bottom frame, which contains the current list of source directories.

You can also add a directory and all its subdirectories recursively by
using the contextual menu in the top frame. This contextual menu also
provides an entry to create new directories, if needed.

To remove source directories from the project, select the directory in
the bottom frame, and click on the up arrow, or use the contextual
menu.

All the files in these directories that match one of the language
supported by the project are automatically associated with that
project.

The relative sizes of the top and bottom frame can be changed by
clicking on the separation line between the two frames and dragging
the line up or down.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------
@subsection Build Directory
@cindex object directory
@cindex exec directory
@c ------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
The object directory is the location where the files resulting from
the compilation of sources (e.g. @file{.o} files) are placed.
One object directory is associated for each project.

The exec directory is the location where the executables are put. By
default, this is the same directory as the object directory.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------
@subsection Naming Scheme
@cindex naming scheme
@c ------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
A naming scheme indicates the file naming conventions used in the different
languages supported by a given project.
For example, all @file{.adb} files are Ada files, all @file{.c} files are
C files.

GPS is very flexible in this respect, and allows you to specify the
default extension for the files in a given programming language. GPS makes a
distinction between spec (or header) files, which generally contain
no executable code, only declarations, and body files which contain
the actual code. For languages other than Ada, this header file is
used rather than the body file when you select @code{Go To
Declaration} in the contextual menu of editors.

In a language like Ada, the distinction between spec and body
is part of the definition of the language itself, and you should be
sure to specify the appropriate extensions.

The default naming scheme for Ada is GNAT's naming scheme (@file{.ads}
for specs and @file{.adb} for bodies). In addition, a number of predefined
naming schemes for other compilers are available in the first combo box on
the page. You can also create your own customized scheme by entering a
free text in the text entries.

@iftex
@cindex screen shot
@image{naming-scheme, 10.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@cindex screen shot
@image{naming-scheme}
@end ifhtml

For all languages, GPS accepts exceptions to this standard naming
scheme. For instance, this let you specify that in addition to using
@file{.adb} for Ada body files, the file @file{foo.ada} should also be
considered as an Ada file.

The list of exceptions is displayed in the bottom list of the naming
scheme editor. To remove entries from this list, select the line you
want to remove, and then press the @key{Del} key.
The contents of the lines can be edited interactively, by
double-clicking on the line and column you want to edit.

To add new entries to this list, use the three fields at the bottom of
the window, and press the update button.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------
@subsection Main Units
@cindex main units
@c ------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
The main units of a project are the files that should be compiled and
linked to obtain executables.

Typically, for C applications, these are the files that contain the
@code{main()} function. For Ada applications, these are the files that
contain the main subprogram each partition in the project.

These files are treated specially by GPS. Some sub-menus of
@code{Build} and @code{Debug} will have predefined entries for the
main units, which make it more convenient to compile and link your
executables.

To add main units click on the @code{Add} button. This opens a file
selection dialog. No check is currently done that the selected file
belongs to the project, but GPS will complain later if it doesn't.

When compiled, each main unit will generate an executable, whose name
is visible in the second column in this page. If you are using a
recent enough version of GNAT (3.16 or more recent), you can change
the name of this executable by clicking in the second column and
changing the name interactively.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------
@subsection Switches
@anchor{Switches}
@cindex switches
@c ------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
The last page of the project wizard is used to select the
default switches to be used by the various tools that GPS calls (compiler,
linker, binder, pretty printer, @dots{}).

@iftex
@cindex screen shot
@image{switch-editor, 10.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@cindex screen shot
@image{switch-editor}
@end ifhtml

This page appears as a notebook, where each page is associated with a
specific tool. All these pages have the same structure:

@table @b
@item Graphical selection of switches
The top part of each page contains a set of buttons, combo boxes,
entry fields, @dots{} which give fast and intuitive access to the most
commonly used switches for that tool.

@item Textual selection of switches
The bottom part is an editable entry field, where you can directly
type the switches. This makes it easier to move from
an older setup (e.g. Makefile, script) to GPS, by copy-pasting switches.
@end table

The two parts of the pages are kept synchronized at any time: clicking
on a button will edit the entry field to show the new switch; adding a
new switch by hand in the entry field will activate the corresponding
button if there is one.

Any switch can be added to the entry field, even if there is no
corresponding button. In this case, GPS will simply forward it to the
tool when it is called, without trying to represent it graphically.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node The Project Properties Editor
@section The Project Properties Editor
@cindex project properties editor
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
The project properties editor gives you access at any time to the properties
of your project. It is accessible through the menu
@code{Project->Edit Project Properties}, and through the contextual menu
@code{Edit project properties} on any project item, e.g. from the Project
View or the Project Browser.

If there was an error loading the project (invalid syntax,
non-existing directories, @dots{}), a warning dialog is displayed when you
select the menu. This reminds you that the project might be only
partially loaded, and editing it might result in the loss of data. In
such cases, it is recommended that you edit the project file manually,
which you can do directly from the pop-up dialog.

Fix the project file as you would for any text file, and then reload
it manually (through the @code{Project->Open...} or
@code{Project->Recent} menus.

@iftex
@cindex screen shot
@image{project-properties, 12.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@cindex screen shot
@image{project-properties}
@end ifhtml

The project propoerties editor is divided in three parts:

@table @b
@item The attributes editor
The contents of this editor are very similar to that of the project
wizard (@pxref{The Project Wizard}). In fact, all pages but the
@code{General} page are exactly the same, and you should therefore
read the description for these in the project wizard chapter.

The general page gives access to more attributes than the general page
of the project wizard does. In addition, you can select the name of all the
external tools that GPS uses (compilers for the various languages,
linker, pretty-printer, @dots{}).

@item The project selector
This area, in the top-right corner of the properties editor, contains
a list of all the projects in the hierarchy. The value in the
attributes editor is applied to all the selected projects in this
selector. You cannot unselect the project for which you activated
the contextual menu.

Clicking on the right title bar (@code{Project}) of this selector will sort the
projects in ascending or descending order.

Clicking on the left title bar (untitled) will select or unselect all
the projects.

This selector has two different possible presentations, chosen by the
toggle button on top: you can either get a sorted list of all the
projects, each one appearing only once. Or you can have the same
project hierarchy as displayed in the project explorer.

@item The scenario selector
This area, in the bottom-right corner of the properties editor, lists
all the scenario variables declared for the project hierarchy. By
selecting some or all of their values, you can chose to which scenario
the modifications in the attributes editor apply.

Clicking on the left title bar (untitled, on the left of the @code{Scenario}
label) will select or unselect all values of all variables.

To select all values of a given variable, click on the corresponding check
button.

@end table

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node The Switches Editor
@section The Switches Editor
@cindex switches editor
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
The switches editor, available through the menu @code{Project->Edit
Switches}, lists all the source files associated with the selected
project.

For each file, the compiler switches are listed. These switches are
displayed in gray if they are the default switches defined at the
project level (@pxref{The Project Properties Editor}). They are defined
in black if they are specific to a given file.

Double-clicking in the switches column allows you to edit the switches
for a specific file. It is possible to edit the switches for multiple
files at the same time by selecting them before displaying the contextual
menu (@code{Edit switches for all selected files}).

When you double-click in one of the columns that contain the switches,
a new dialog is opened that allows you to edit the switches specific to
the selected files.

This dialog has a button titled @code{Revert}. Clicking on this button

@noindent
The project graph is a special kind of browser (@pxref{Source
Browsing}). It shows the dependencies between all the project in the
project hierarchy. Two items in this browser will be linked if one of
them imports the other.

@cindex examine projects imported by
It is accessed through the contextual menu in the project explorer, by
selecting the @code{Show projects imported by...} item, when
right-clicking on a project node.

Clicking on the left arrow in the title bar of the items will display
all the projects that import that project. Similarly, clicking
on the right arrow will display all the projects that are imported by
that project.

The contextual menu obtained by right-clicking on a project item
contains several items. Most of them are added by the project editor,
and gives direct access to editing the properties of the project,
adding dependencies@dots{}

Some new items are added to the menu:

@table @command
@item Locate in explorer
@cindex locate in explorer
Selecting this item will switch the focus to the project explorer, and
highlight the first project node found that matches the project in the
browser item. This is a convenient way to get information like the
list of directories or source files for that project.

@item Show dependencies
@cindex show dependencies
This item plays the same role as the right arrow in the title bar, and
display all the projects in the hierarchy that are imported directly
by the selected project

@item Show recursive dependencies
@cindex show recursive dependencies
This item will display all the dependencies recursively for the
project (i.e. the projects it imports directly, the projects that
are imported by them, and so on).

@item Show projects depending on
@cindex show projects depending on
This item plays the same role as the left arrow in the title bar, and

GPS provides extensive search capabilities among its different
elements. For instance, it is possible to search in the currently
edited source file, or in all the source files belonging to the
project, even those that are not currently open. It is also possible
to search in the project explorer (on the left side of the main GPS
window), or the help modules,@dots{}
@cindex project explorer

@cindex menu
@cindex key
@cindex search context
All these search contexts are grouped into a single graphical window,
that you can open either through the menu @code{Navigate->Find/Replace...}, or
the shortcut @key{Ctrl-F}.

Selecting either of these two options will pop up a dialog on the
screen, similar to the following:

@iftex
@cindex screen shot
@image{search-hide, 7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@cindex screen shot
@image{search-hide}
@end ifhtml

On this screen shot, you can see three entry fields:

@table @command
@item Search for
@cindex search for
This is the location where you type the string or pattern you are
looking for. The search widget supports two modes, either fixed strings
or regular expressions. You can commute between the two modes by
either clicking on the @code{Options} button and selecting the
appropriate check box, or by opening the combo box (click on the arrow
on the right of the entry field).

In this combo box, a number of predefined patterns are provided. The
top two ones are empty patterns, that automatically set up the
appropriate fixed strings/regular expression mode. The other regular
expressions are language-specific, and will match patterns like Ada
type definition, C++ method declaration,@dots{}
@cindex C++
@cindex Ada

@item Replace with
@cindex replace with
This field should contain the string that will replace the occurrences
of the pattern defined above.
The combo box provides a history of previously used replacement
strings.

@item Look in
@cindex look in
This field defines the context in which the search should
occur.
@cindex search context
GPS will automatically select the most appropriate context when you
open the search dialog, depending on which component currently has the
focus. You can of course change the context to another one if needed.

Clicking on the arrow on the right will display the list of all
possible contexts. This list includes:

@table @code
@item Project Explorer
Search in the project explorer. An extra @i{Scope} box will be displayed
where you can specify the scope of your search, which can be a set of:
@code{Projects, Directories, Files, Entities}. The search in entities
may take a long time, search each file is parsed during the search.

@item Open Files
Search in all the files that are currenly open in the source editor. The
@i{Scope} entry is described in the @code{Files...} section below.

@item Files...
Search in a given set of files. An extra @i{Files} box will be displayed
where you can specify the files by using standard shell (Unix or Windows)
regular expression, e.g. @code{*.ad?} for all files ending with .ad and any
trailing character. The directory specified where the search starts, and
the @i{Recursive search} button whether sub directories will be searched
as well.

The @i{Scope} entry is used to restrict the search to a set of language
constructs, e.g. to avoid matching on comments when you
are only interested in actual code, or to only search strings and
comments, and ignore the code.

@item Files From Project
Search in all the files from the project, including files from project
dependencies. The @i{Scope} entry is described in the @code{Files...}
section above.

@item Current File
Search in the current source editor.
The @i{Scope} entry is described in the @code{Files...} section above.

@item Project Browser
Search in the project browser (@pxref{The Project Browser}).

@item Help
Search in the help window.
@end table

@end table

The second part of the window is a row of buttons, to start the search
(or continue to the next occurrence), to stop the current search when
it is taking too long, or to display the options.

@iftex
@cindex screen shot
@image{search-options, 7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@cindex screen shot
@image{search-options}
@end ifhtml

There are four check boxes in this options box.

@table @b
@item @code{"Search All Occurrences"}
@cindex search all occurrences
The default mode for the search widget is interactive searching: its
stops as soon as one occurrence of the pattern is found. You then have
to press the @code{Next} button (or the equivalent shortcut
@key{Ctrl-N}) to go to the next occurrence.

However, if you enable this check box, the search widget will start
searching for all occurrences right away, and put the results in a new
window called @code{Locations} (initially found in the bottom dock of
the GPS window). You can interrupt the search at any time by pressing
the @code{Stop} button: this will stop when the next occurrence is found.

@item @code{"Case Sensitive"}
@cindex case sensitive
By default, patterns are case insensitive (upper-case letters and
lower-case letters are considered as equivalent). You can change this
behavior by clicking on this check box.

@item @code{"Whole Word Only"}
@cindex whole word
If activated, this check box will force the search engine to ignore
substrings. "sensitive" will no longer match "insensitive".

@item @code{"Regular Expression"}
@cindex regular expression
This button commutes between fixed string patterns and regular
expressions. You can also commute between these two modes
by selecting the arrow on the right of the @code{Search for:} field.
The grammar followed by the regular expressions is similar to the Perl and
Python regular expressions grammar, and is documented in the GNAT run time file
@file{g-regpat.ads}. To open it from GPS, you can use the open from project
dialog (@code{File->Open From Project...}) and type g-regpat.ads. See
@ref{Open From Project} for more information on this dialog.

@end table

@cindex MDI
@cindex Multiple Document Interface
As most GPS components, the search window is under control of the
multiple document interface, and can thus be integrated into the main
GPS window instead of being an external window.

@cindex menu
To force this behavior, open the menu @code{Window}, select
@code{Search} in the list at the bottom of the menu, and then select
either @code{Floating} or @code{Docked}.

If you save the desktop (@code{File->Save More->Desktop}, GPS will
automatically reopen the search dialog in its new place when it is
started next time.

or through the @code{Build} and @code{Run} contextual menu items, as
described in the following section.

When compiler messages are detected by GPS, an entry is added in the
@i{Locations tree}, allowing you to easily navigate through the compiler
messages (see @ref{The Locations Tree}), or even to automatically correct some
errors or warnings (see @ref{Code Fixing}).

@node The Build Menu
@section The Build Menu
@noindent
The build menu gives access to capabilities related to checking, parsing and
compiling files, as well as creating and running executables.

@table @b
@item Check Syntax
Check the syntax of the current source file. Display an error message in
the @i{Messages} window if no file is currently selected.

@item Compile File
Compile the current file. Display an error message in the @i{Messages} window if
no file is selected.

If errors or warnings occur during the compilation, the corresponding locations
will appear in the Locations Tree. If the corresponding Preference is set, the
source lines will be highlighted in the editors (see
@ref{The Preferences Dialog}).
To remove the highlighting on these lines, remove the files from the Locations
Tree.

@item Make
   @table @i
   @item main
   For each main source file defined in your top level project, an entry
   is listed to build (compile, bind, link) this source file.
   Similarly the @code{Build} contextual menu accessible from a project
   entity contains the same entries.

   @item Project
   Build all main files defined in your top level project, or all source
   files if no main file are defined.

   @item <current file>
   Consider the currently selected file as a main file, and build it.

   @item Custom...
   Display a text entry where you can enter any external command. This menu
   is very useful when you already have existing build scripts, make files,
   @dots{} and want to invoke them from GPS.

   @end table

@item Recompute C/C++ Xref info
@cindex C
@cindex C++
Recompute the cross-reference information for C and C++ source files.
@xref{Support for Cross-References}.

@item Run
   @table @i
   @item main
   For each main source file defined in your top level project, an entry
   is listed to run the executable associated with this main file.
   Running an application will first open a dialog where you can specify
   command line arguments to your application, if needed. You can also
   specify whether the application should be run within GPS (the default),
   or using an external terminal.

   When running an application from GPS, a new execution window is added in the
   bottom area where input and output of the application is handled. This
   window is never closed automatically, even when the application terminates,
   so that you can still have access to the application's output. If you
   explicitly close an execution window while an application is still running,
   a dialog window will be displayed to confirm whether the application should
   be terminated.

   When using an external terminal, GPS launches an external terminal
   utility that will take care of the execution and input/output of your
   application. This external utility can be configured in the preferences
   dialog (@i{Helpers->Execute command}).

   Similarly, the @code{Run} contextual menu accessible from a project
   entity contains the same entries.

   @item Custom...
   Similar to the entry above, except that you can run any arbitrary executable.

@node Integrating existing build procedures with the GPS build system
@section Integrating existing build procedures with the GPS build system
@noindent
@i{Note that this capability is not fully supported yet.}

Since the multi-language build system provided by GPS is based on makefiles,
it is possible to integrate existing build scripts and makefiles. In the
following section, we will call such projects that integrate with existing
build procedures a @i{foreign project}.

You first need to provide your own @code{Makefile.<project>} file, that will
provide stubs to the real build commands.

Then to tell GPS that it should not generate automatically the makefile
corresponding to a given project, set the read-only attribute on the
makefile, e.g under Unix:
@cindex Unix

@cindex example
@smallexample
$ chmod -w Makefile.<project>
@end smallexample

@cindex Windows
or under Windows:

@smallexample
@cindex example
> attrib +r Makefile.<project>
@end smallexample

This way when saving the project, GPS knows that the existing makefile
should not be overridden.

Depending on your project, you will need to define some or all of the
following targets in the makefile stub:

@table @b
@item internal-build
This is the main rule, used for building all the files for a foreign
project.

@item internal-clean
This is an optional rule, used to clean the temporary files, e.g. the
object files generated during the build.

@item SRC_DIRS
Blank separated list of source directories.

@item LDFLAGS
Linker options (e.g. libraries or objects to link with).

@item DEPS_PROJECTS
List of projects (foreign or non foreign) that this project depends upon.

@end table

For example, suppose we have a foreign project called @code{Foo},
with an existing makefile, here is how Makefile.foo would look like:

@cindex example
@smallexample
ifeq ($(FOO_PROJECT),)
FOO_PROJECT=True

ifeq ($(BASE_DIR),)
   BASE_DIR=$(shell pwd)
   FOO_ROOT=True

# Redirect clean to the real clean rule
   internal-clean:
        $(MAKE) clean

# Ditto for the build rule
   internal-build:
        $(MAKE) build
endif

FOO_BASE_DIR := $(BASE_DIR)

# Add our source directories to the default search path
# so that other projects can reference our include files
FOO_SRC_DIRS = $(FOO_BASE_DIR)/include $(FOO_BASE_DIR)/include2
SRC_DIRS += $(FOO_SRC_DIRS)

# Add <build>/libfoo.a, built by the internal-build rule above, to the
# list of libraries to link with
LDFLAGS += $(FOO_BASE_DIR)/<build>/libfoo.a

ifneq ($(FOO_ROOT),True)
   DEPS_PROJECTS += $(FOO_BASE_DIR)/foo
endif

endif

@section General Issues
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
GPS contains several kinds of browsers, that have a common set of
basic functionalities. There are currently four such browsers: the
project browser (@pxref{The Project Browser}), the call graph
(@pxref{Call Graph}), the dependency browser (@pxref{Dependency
Browser}) and the entity browser (@pxref{Entity Browser}).

All these browsers are interactive viewers. They contain a number of
items, whose visual representation depends on the type of information
displayed in the browser (they can be projects, files, entities, @dots{}).

In addition, the following capabilities are provided in all browsers:

@table @b
@item Scrolling
When a lot of items are displayed in the canvas, the currently visible
area might be too small to display all of them. In this case,
scrollbars will be added on the sides, so that you can make other
items visible. Scrolling can also be done with the arrow keys.

@item Layout
A basic layout algorithm is used to organize the items. This algorithm
is layer oriented: items with no parents are put in the first layer,
then their direct children are put in the second layer, and so
on. Depending on the type of browser, these layers are organized
either vertically or horizontally. This algorithm tries to preserve as
much as possible the positions of the items that were moved
interactively.

The @code{refresh layout} menu item in the background contextual menu
can be used to recompute the layout of items at any time, even for
items that were previously moved interactively.

@item Interactive moving of items
Items can be moved interactively with the mouse. Click and drag the
item by clicking on its title bar. The links will still be displayed
during the move, so that you can check whether it overlaps any other
item. If you are trying to move the item outside of the visible part
of the browser, the latter will be scrolled.

@item Links
Items can be linked together, and will remain connected when items are
moved. Different types of links exist, see the description of the
various browsers.

By default, links are displayed as straight lines. You can choose to
use orthogonal links instead, which are displayed only with vertical
or horizontal lines. Select the entry @code{orthogonal links} in the
background contextual menu.

@item Zooming
Several different zoom levels are available. The contextual menu in
the background of the browser contains three entries: @code{zoom in},
@code{zoom out} and @code{zoom}. The latter is used to select directly
the zoom level you want.

This zooming capability is generally useful when lots of items are
displayed in the browser, to get a more general view of the layout and
the relationships between the items.

@item Selecting items
Items can be selected by clicking inside them. Multiple items can be
selected by holding the @key{control} key while clicking in the
item. Alternatively, you can click and drag the mouse inside the
background of the browser. All the items found in the selection
rectangle when the mouse is released will be selected.

Selected items are drawn with a different title bar color. All items
linked to them also use a different title bar color, as well as the
links. This is the most convenient way to understand the relationships
between items when lots of them are present in the browser.

@item Hyper-links
Some of the items will contain hyper links, displayed in blue by
default, and underlined. Clicking on these will generally display new
items.

@end table

Two types of contextual menus are available in the browsers: the
background contextual menu is available by right-clicking in the
background area (i.e. outside of any item). As described above, it
contains entries for the zooming, selecting of orthogonal links, and
refresh; the second kind of contextual menu is available by
right-clicking in items.

The latter menu contains various entries. Most of the entries are
added by various modules in GPS (VCS module, source
editor, @dots{}). In addition, each kind of browser also has some specific
entries, which is described in the corresponding browser's section.

There are two common items in all item contextual menus:

@table @command
@item Hide Links
Browsers can become confusing if there are many items and many
links. You can lighten them by selecting this menu entry. As
a result, the item will remain in the canvas, but none of the links to
or from it will be visible. Selecting the item will still
highlight linked items, so that this information remains available.

@item Remove all other items
Selecting this menu item will remove all items but the selected one.

@end table

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Call Graph
@section Call Graph
@cindex call graph
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
The call graph shows graphically the relationship between subprogram
callers and callees. A link between two items indicate that one of
them is calling the other.

@cindex renaming entities
A special handling is provided for renaming entities (in Ada): if a
subprogram is a renaming of another one, both items will be displayed
in the browser, with a special hashed link between the two. Since the
renaming subprogram doesn't have a proper body, you will then need to
ask for the subprograms called by the renamed to get the list.

@iftex
@cindex screen shot
@image{call-graph, 12.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@cindex screen shot
@image{call-graph}
@end ifhtml

In this browser, clicking on the right arrow in the title bar will
display all the entities that are called by the selected item.

Clicking on the left arrow will display all the entities that call the
selected item (i.e. its callers).

This browser is accessible through the contextual menu in the project
explorer and source editor, by selecting one of the items:

@table @command
@item References->@i{Entity} calls
Display all the entities called by the selected entity. This has the
same effect as clicking on the right title bar arrow if the item is
already present in the call graph.

@item References->@i{Entity} is called by
Display all the entities called by the selected entity. This has the
same effect as clicking on the left title bar arrow if the item is
already present in the call graph.
@end table

The contextual menu available by right-clicking on the entities in the
browser has the following new entries, in addition to the ones added by
other modules of GPS.

@table @command
@item @i{Entity} calls
Same as described above.

@item @i{Entity} is called by
Same as described above.

@item Go To Spec
Selecting this item will open a source editor that displays the
declaration of the entity.

@item Go To Body
Selecting this item will open a source editor that displays the
body of the entity.

@item Locate in explorer
Selecting this menu entry will move the focus to the project explorer,
and select the first node representing the file in which the entity is
declared. This makes it easier to see which other entities are
declared in the same file.
@end table

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Dependency Browser
@section Dependency Browser
@cindex dependency browser
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
The dependency browser shows the dependencies between source
files. Each item in the browser represents one source file.

@iftex
@cindex screen shot
@image{dependency-browser, 12.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@cindex screen shot
@image{dependency-browser}
@end ifhtml

In this browser, clicking on the right arrow in the title bar will
display the list of files that the selected file depends on. A file
depend on another one if it explicitly imports it (@code{with}
statement in Ada, or @code{#include} in C/C++). Implicit dependencies
are currently not displayed in this browser, since the information is
accessible by opening the other direct dependencies.

Clicking on the left arrow in the title bar will display the list of
files that depend on the selected file.

This browser is accessible through the contextual menu in the
explorer, by selecting one of the following items:

@table @command
@item Show dependencies for @i{file}
@cindex show dependencies for

This has the same effect as clicking on the right arrow for a file
already in the browser, and will display the direct dependencies for
that file.

@item Show files depending on @i{file}
@cindex show files depending on

This has the same effect as clicking on the left arrow for a file
already in the browser, and will display the list of files that
directly depend on that file.

@end table

The background contextual menu in the browser adds a few entries to
the standard menu:

@table @command
@item Open file...

This menu entry will display an external dialog in which you can
select the name of a file to analyze.

@item Refresh
@cindex refresh

This menu entry will check that all links displays in the dependency
browser are still valid. If not, they are removed. The arrows in the
title bar are also reset if necessary, in case new dependencies were
added for the files.

The browser is not refreshed automatically, since there are lots of
cases where the dependencies might change (editing source files,
changing the project hierarchy or the value of the scenario
variables,...)

@item Show system files
@cindex show system files

This menu entry indicates whether standard system files (runtime files
for instance in the case of Ada) are displayed in the browser. By
default, these files will only be displayed if you explicitly select
them through the @code{Open file} menu, or the contextual menu in the
project explorer.

@item Show implicit dependencies
@cindex show implicit dependencies

This menu entry indicates whether implicit dependencies should also be
displayed for the files. Implicit dependencies are files that are
required to compile the selected file, but that are not explicitly
imported through a @code{with} or @code{#include} statement. For
instance, the body of generics in Ada is an implicit dependency.
Any time one of the implicit dependencies is modified, the selected
file should be recompiled as well.

@end table

The contextual menu available by right clicking on an item also adds a
number of entries:

@table @command
@item Analyze other file
@cindex analyze other file

This will open a new item in the browser, displaying the complement
file for the selected one. In Ada, this would be the body if you
clicked on a spec file, or the opposite. In C, it depends on the
naming conventions you specified in the project properties, but you
would generally go from a @file{.h} file to a @file{.c} file and back.

@item Show dependencies for @i{file}
@cindex show files depending on file

These play the same role as in the project explorer contextual menu

@end table

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Entity Browser
@section Entity Browser
@cindex entity browser
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
The entity browser displays static information about any source
entity.

The exact content of the items depend on the type of the item. For
instance:

@table @code
@item Ada record / C struct
The list of fields, each as an hyper link, is displayed. Clicking on
one of the fields will open a new item for the type.

@item Ada tagged type / C++ class
The list of attributes and methods is displayed. They are also
click-able hyper-links.

@item Subprograms
The list of parameters is displayed

@item Packages
The list of all the entities declared in that package is displayed

@item and more ...

@end table

@iftex
@cindex screen shot
@image{entity-browser, 12.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@cindex screen shot
@image{entity-browser}
@end ifhtml

This browser is accessible through the contextual menu in the
explorer, when clicking on an entity:

@table @command
@item Examine entity @i{entity}
@cindex examine entity

Open a new item in the entity browser that displays information for
the selected entity.

@end table

Most information in the items are click-able (by default, they appear as
underlined blue text). Clicking on one of these hyper links will open
a new item in the entity browser for the selected entity.

This browser can display the parent entities for an item. For
instance, for a C++ class or Ada tagged type, this would be the types
it derives from. This is accessible by clicking on the up arrow in the
title bar of the item.

Likewise, children entities (for instance types that derive from the
item) can be displayed by clicking on the down arrow in the title bar.

An extra button appear in the title bar for the C++ class or Ada
tagged types, which toggles whether the inherited methods (or
primitive operations in Ada) should be displayed. By default, only the
new methods, or the ones that override an inherited one, are
displayed. The parent's methods are not shown, unless you click on this
title bar button.

@node Debugging
@chapter Debugging
@cindex debugger
@cindex debugging
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
GPS is also a graphical front-end for text-based debuggers such as GDB.
A knowledge of the basics of the underlying debugger used by GPS will help
understanding how GPS works and what kind of functionalities it provides.

Please refer to the debugger-specific documentation -
e.g. the GDB documentation
@ifhtml
(@url{gdb.html})
@end ifhtml
- for more details.

The integrated debugger provided by GPS is using an improved version of
the GVD engine, so the functionalities between GVD and GPS are very similar.
If you are familiar with GVD, you may be interested in reading
@ref{Upgrading from GVD to GPS} which explains the differences between the
two environments.

Debugging is tightly integrated with the other components of GPS. For
example, it is possible to edit files and navigate through your sources
while debugging.

@cindex menu
To start a debug session, go to the menu @code{Debug->Initialize}, and choose
either the name of your executable, if you have specified the name of
your main program(s) in the project properties, or start an empty debug
session using the @code{<no main file>} item. It is then possible to load
any file to debug, by using the menu @code{Debug->Debug->Load File...}

Note that you can create multiple debuggers by using the @code{Initialize}
menu several times: this will create a new debugger each time.
All the debugger-related actions (e.g. stepping, running) are performed on
the current debugger, which is represented by the current debugger console.
To switch between debuggers, simply select its corresponding console.

After the debugger has been initialized, you have access to two new windows:
the data window (in the top of the working area), and the debugger console
(in a new page, after the Messages and Shell windows).
All the menus under @code{Debugger}
are now also accessible, and you also have access to additional contextual
menus, in particular in the source editor where it is possible to easily
display variables, set breakpoints, and get automatic display
(via @i{tool tips}) of object values.

When you want to quit the debugger without quitting GPS, go to the menu
@code{Debug->Terminate Current}, that will terminate your current debug
session, or the menu @code{Debug->Terminate} that will terminate all your
debug sessions at once.

@node Upgrading from GVD to GPS
@section Upgrading from GVD to GPS
@noindent
This section is intended for users already familiar with GVD, in order
to help them transitioning to GPS. If you have not used GVD, you may want
to skip this section.

This section outlines the differences between GVD and GPS, and also
lists some of the advantages of GPS compared to GVD.

@subsection Command Line Switches
@noindent
The following command line switches related to debugging are available
in GPS:

@table @code
@item --debug
Automatically start a debug session, as done by GVD.
You can also specify a program name and its arguments, so this
option replaces the @code{--pargs} and @code{executable-file} arguments in GVD.

@item --debugger
Equivalent to the same GVD option, with the difference that
arguments can be specified as well, replacing the @code{--dargs} option.

@item --target
Same as in GVD.
@end table

For example, the equivalent of the following command line:

@smallexample
$ gvd --debugger=gdb-5 executable --pargs 1 2 3
@end smallexample

would be

@smallexample
$ gps --debug='executable 1 2 3' --debugger=gdb-5
@end smallexample

@subsection Menu Items
@noindent
All the debugger-related menus in GVD can be found under the 'Debug'
menu in GPS, with the following mapping:

@table @code
@item File->xxx
available under @code{Debug->Debug->xxx}

@item Program->xxx
available under @code{Debug->xxx}

@item Data->xxx
available under @code{Debug->Data->xxx}
@end table

The menu @code{File->New Debugger...} is replaced by the combination of
the menu @code{Debug->Initialize} and the project properties, available
under @code{Project->Edit Project Properties} where you can similarly
specify your @i{Debugger Host} (called @i{Tools Host}), your
@i{Program Host}, the @i{Protocol} used by the underlying debugger
to communicate with the target, and the name of the debugger.
To conveniently switch between multiple debugger configurations, we
recommend to use a scenario variable and set different properties based
on the value of this variable. See
@ref{Scenarios and Configuration Variables} and
@ref{Working in a Cross Environment} for more details.

@subsection Tool Bar Buttons
@noindent
GPS provides by default fewer debugger buttons than GVD, because some
buttons are actually not used very often, and others have been merged.
In addition, it will be possible in the future to completely configure
the GPS tool bar.

@table @code
@item Run
Menu @code{Debug->Run...} (@key{F2})

@item Start
Start/Continue button

@item Step
Step button

@item Stepi
Menu @code{Debug->Step Instruction} (@key{Shift-F5})

@item Next
Next button

@item Nexti
Menu @code{Debug->Next Instruction} (@key{Shift-F6})

@item Finish
Finish button

@item Cont
Start/Continue button

@item Up
Up button

@item Down
Down button

@item Interrupt
Menu @code{Debug->Interrupt} (@key{Control-Blackslash})
@end table

@subsection Key Short Cuts
@noindent
The same key shortcuts have been kept by default between GVD and GPS
except for the Interrupt menu, which is now @key{Control-Backslash} instead
of @key{Esc}.

@subsection Contextual Menus
@noindent
All the debugger-related contextual menus can now be found under the
@code{Debug} sub-menu.

The only difference is the contextual menu @code{Show} used to display
the assembly dump of the current code. It is replaced by the menu
@code{Debug->Data->Assembly}, see @ref{The Assembly Window} for more
details.

@subsection File Explorer
@noindent
The file explorer provided in GVD is replaced by the @code{Project View}
and the @code{File View} in GPS.

When using the @code{--debug} command line switch and no explicit project
file, GPS will automatically create a project file in a way very
similar to what GVD does to display its file explorer, and available under
the @code{Project View}.

In addition, the @code{File View} gives access to any file in your file
system, even if it is not available as part of the debug information.

@subsection Advantages of GPS
@noindent
The advantages when using GPS instead of GVD can be classified in two main
categories: when not using project files, and when using them.

When not using project files, you get access to the following advantages
in GPS:

@itemize @bullet
@item Complete source editor including indentation, shortcuts, multiple
views, @dots{}
See @ref{Editing Files} for more details.

@item A more stable and robust debugger engine.
The debugger engine included in GPS corresponds to GVD version 2.0.
In effect, GPS @i{is} the new version of GVD.

@item Integrated help, see @ref{Integrated Help} for more details.

@item Better look and feel.
GPS uses the new version of the graphical toolkit used by GVD, which
provides a modern look and feel and a more stable interface under Windows
(with additions such as support for the mouse wheel).

@item Support for version control systems
which is integrated and available through a few mouse clicks or key bindings.
See @ref{Version Control System} for more details.

@item A more flexible window handling,
see @ref{Multiple Document Interface} for more details.
@end itemize

When using project files, you will get, in addition to the advantages listed
above:

@itemize @bullet
@item Source navigation, see @ref{Source Navigation} for more details.

@item Source Browsers,
in particular the entity browser, a nice complement of the debugger data window.
See @ref{Source Browsing} for more details.

@item Builds, see @ref{Compilation/Build} for more details.

@item Semantic support.
In particular, future versions of GPS will be able to e.g. differentiate
variables from types when displaying a contextual menu, which is not possible
in GVD.

@item Flexibility of project files, see @ref{Project Handling} for more details.

@menu
* The VCS Explorer::

@end menu

GPS offers the possibility for multiple developers to work on the same project,
through the integration of version control systems (VCS). Each project can be
associated to a VCS, through the @code{VCS} tab in the Project property
editor. @xref{The Project Properties Editor}.

The systems that are currently supported in GPS are CVS and ClearCase.
It is recommended that you first get familiar with the version control
system that you intend to use in GPS first, since many concepts used in GPS
assume basic knowledge of the underlying system.

Associating a VCS to a project enables the use of basic VCS features on the
source files contained in the project. Those basic features typically include
the checking in and out of files, the querying of file status, file revision
history, comparison between various revisions, and so on.

Administration of VCS systems is not handled by GPS at this
stage. Therefore, before working on a project using version control
system, make sure that the system is properly set-up before launching
GPS.

Note: the set-up must make sure that the VCS commands can be launched without
entering a password.

@node The VCS Explorer
@section The VCS Explorer
@cindex VCS explorer
@cindex version control
@noindent

The VCS Explorer provides an overview of source files and their status.

@iftex
@cindex screen shot
@image{vcs-explorer, 10.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@cindex screen shot
@image{vcs-explorer}
@end ifhtml

The easiest way to bring up the VCS Explorer is through the menu
@code{VCS->Explorer}. The Explorer can also be brought up using the
contextual menu @code{Version Control->Query status} on files,
directories and projects in the file and project views, and on file
editors. @xref{The Version Control Contextual Menu}.

The VCS Explorer contains the following columns:

@table @b
@item Status
Shows the status of the file. This column can be sorted by clicking on
the header. The different possible status for files are the following:

@table @code
@item Unknown
The status is not yet determined or the VCS repository is not able to
give this information (for example if it is unavailable, or locked).

@item Not registered
The file is not known to the VCS repository.

@item Up-to-date
The file corresponds to the latest version in the corresponding branch
on the repository.

@item Added
The file has been added remotely but is not yet updated in the local
view.

@item Removed
The file still exists locally but is known to have been removed from
the VCS repository.

@item Modified
The file has been modified by the user or has been explicitly opened
for editing.

@item Needs merge
The file has been modified locally and on the repository.

@item Needs update
The file has been modified in the repository but not locally.

@end table

@item Log
This column indicates whether a revision log exists for this file.

@item File
The name of the file. This column can be sorted by clicking on the
header.

@item Working rev.
Indicates the version of the local file.

@item Head rev.
Indicates the most recent version of the file in the repository.

@end table

The VCS Explorer supports multiple selections. To select a single
line, simply left-click on it. To select a range of lines, select the
first line in the range, then hold down the @key{Shift} key and select the
last line in the range. To add or remove single columns from the
selection, hold down the @key{Control} key and left-click on the
columns that you want to select/unselect.

@cindex interactive search
The explorer also provides an interactive search capability allowing you to
quickly look for a given file name. The default key to start an interactive
search is @key{Ctrl-i}. See @ref{Interactive Search} for more details.

The VCS contextual menu can be brought up from the VCS explorer by
left-clicking on a selection or on a single line. @xref{The Version
Control Contextual Menu}.

@node The VCS Menu
@section The VCS Menu
@cindex version control
@cindex menu
@noindent

Basic VCS operations can be accessed through the VCS menu. Most of
these functions act on the current selection, i.e. on the selected items
in the VCS Explorer if it is present, or on the currently selected
file editor, or on the currently selected item in the Project/File
View. In most cases, the VCS contextual menu offers more control on
VCS operations. @xref{The Version Control Contextual Menu}.

@table @b
@item Explorer
Open or raise the VCS Explorer. @xref{The VCS Explorer}.

@item Update all projects
Update the source files in the current project, and all imported
sub-projects, recursively.

@item Query status for all projects
Query the status of all files in the project and all imported sub-projects.

@item Update
@anchor{Update}
Update the currently selected item (file, directory or project).

@item Commit
@anchor{Commit}
Submits the changes made to the file to the repository, and queries
the status for the file once the change is made.

It is possible to tell GPS to check the file before the actual commit
happens. This is done by specifying a @code{File checker} in the
@code{VCS} tab of the project properties dialog. This @code{File
checker} is in fact a script or executable that takes an absolute file
name as argument, and displays any error message on the standard
output. The VCS commit operation will actually occur only if nothing
was written on the standard output.

It is also possible to check the change-log of a file before commit, by
specifying a @code{Log checker} in the project properties dialog. This
works on change-log files in the same way as the @code{File checker} works on
source files.

@item Start Editing
@anchor{Start Editing}
Open the currently selected file for writing. On some VCS systems,
this is a necessary operation, and on other systems it is not.

@item View revision history
@anchor{View revision history}
Show the revision logs for all previous revisions of this file.

@item Compare against head rev.
@cindex compare
@anchor{Compare against head}

Show a visual comparison between the local file and the most recent
version of that file in the repository.

@item Compare against working rev.
@anchor{Compare against working}

version of that file in the repository.

@item Compare working against head rev.
@anchor{Compare working against head}
Show a visual comparison between the corresponding version of the
file in the repository and the most recent version of that file.

@item Annotate
@anchor{Annotate}
Display the annotations for the file, i.e. the information for each
line of the file showing the revision corresponding to that file, and
additional information depending on the VCS system.

@item Remove annotations
Remove the annotations from the selected file.

@item Edit revision log
Edit the current revision log for the selected file.

@c @item Revert
@item Add to repository
Add a file to the repository.

@item Remove from repository

@section Visual Comparison
@cindex visual diff
@noindent
@i{Note that this tool is in a preliminary stage. More capabilities will
be added in the future such as comparison of multiple files, interactive
merge, @dots{}}.

The visual comparison, available either from the VCS menus or from the Tools
menu, provide a way to display graphically differences between two files,
or two different versions of the same file.

This tool is based on the standard text command @command{diff}, available
on all Unix systems. Under Windows, you need to provide a proper equivalent,
by e.g. installing a set of Unix tools such as cygwin
(@url{http://www.cygwin.com}).

The dialog is composed of two main areas: on the left side, the reference
file is displayed; on the right side, the modified file.

By default, only chunks of differences are displayed, with a number of lines
of context around, that can be parametrized in the preferences dialog.

Vertical and horizontal scroll bars are available for each file that allow you
to scroll both files at the same time. In addition, empty lines are added
when needed so that the two files can always be displayed side by side and
stay synchronized.

@item gray
This color is used for all the chunks on the reference (left) file. Only
the modified (right) file is displayed with different colors.

@item blue
This color is used to display lines that have been modified compared to the
reference file.

@item green
Used to display lines added compared to the reference file; in other words,
lines that are not present in the reference file.

@item red
Used to display lines removed from the reference file; in other words,
lines that are present only in the reference file.

@node Code Fixing
@section Code Fixing
@cindex code fixing
@cindex wrench icon
@noindent

GPS provides an interactive way to fix or improve your source code, based on
messages (errors and warnings) generated by the GNAT compiler.

@c There are two ways to access this capability: the first (and preferred) one
@c is integrated with the @i{Locations tree} (see @ref{The Locations Tree}); the
@c other provides a separate dialog accessible through the menu
@c @code{Tools->Code Fixing}.

This capability is integrated with the @i{Locations tree} (see
@ref{The Locations Tree}): when GPS can take advantage of a compiler message,
an icon is added on the left side of the line.

For a simple fix, a wrench icon is displayed. If you click with
the left button on this icon, the code will be fixed automatically, and you
will see the change in the corresponding source editor. An example of a simple
fix, is the addition of a missing semicolon.

You can also check what action will be performed by clicking on the right
button which will display a contextual menu with a text explaining the action
that will be performed. Similarly, if you display the contextual menu anywhere
else on the message line, a sub menu called @i{Code Fixing} gives you
access to the same information. In the previous example of a missing
semicolon, the menu will contain an entry labeled @i{Add expected string ";"}.

Once the code change has been performed, the tool icon is no longer displayed.

For more complex fixes, where more than one change is possible, the icon
will display in additional of the tool, a red question mark. In this case,
clicking on the icon will display the contextual menu directly, giving you
access to the possible choices. For example, this will be the case when
an ambiguity is reported by the compiler for resolving an entity.

* Customizing your Projects::
* Debugger Issues::
@end menu

@noindent
This chapter explains how to adapt your project and configure GPS when working
in a cross environment.

@node Customizing your Projects
@section Customizing your Projects
@cindex project

@noindent
This section describes some possible ways to customize your projects when
working in a cross environment. For more details on the project capabilities,
see @ref{Project Handling}.

When using the project editor to modify the project's properties, two
areas are particularly relevant to cross environments: @code{Tools} and
@code{Cross environment}, part of the @code{General} page.

In the @code{Tools} section, you will typically need to change the name of
the compiler(s) and the debugger, as well as gnatls' name if you are
using Ada.

For example, assuming you have an Ada project, and using a powerpc VxWorks
configuration. You will set the @i{Ada compiler} to
@code{powerpc-wrs-vxworks-gnatmake}; @i{Gnatls} to
@code{powerpc-wrs-vxworks-gnatls} and @i{Debugger} to
@code{powerpc-wrs-vxworks-gdb}.

If you are using an alternative run time, e.g. a @i{soft float} run time,
you need to add the option @code{--RTS=soft-float} to the @i{Gnatls}
property, e.g: @code{powerpc-wrs-vxworks-gnatls --RTS=soft-float}, and
add this same option to the @i{Make} switches in the switch editor.
See @ref{Switches} for more details on the switch editor.

To modify your project to support configurations such as multiple targets,
or multiple hosts, you can create scenario variables, and modify the setting
of the Tools parameters based on the value of these variables. See
@ref{Scenarios and Configuration Variables} for more information on these
variables.

For example, you may want to create a variable called @code{Target} to handle
the different kind of targets handled in your project:

@table @b
@item Target
   Native, Embedded
@item Target
   Native, PowerPC, M68K
@end table

Similarly, you may define a @code{Board} variable listing the different
boards used in your environment and change the @i{Program host} and @i{Protocol}
settings accordingly.

In some cases, it is useful to provide a different body file for a given
package (e.g. to handle target specific differences). A possible approach
in this case is to use a configuration variable (e.g. called @code{TARGET}),
and specify a different naming scheme for this body file (in the project
properties, @code{Naming} tab), based on the value of @code{TARGET}.

@node Debugger Issues
@section Debugger Issues
@cindex debugger
@noindent
This section describes some debugger issues that are specific to cross
environments. You will find more information on debugging by reading
@ref{Debugging}.

To connect automatically to the right remote debug agent when
starting a debugging session (using the menu @code{Debug->Initialize}),
be sure to specify the @code{Program host} and @code{Protocol} project
properties, as described in the previous section.

For example, if you are using the @i{Tornado} environment, with a target
server called @code{target_ppc}, set the @code{Protocol} to @code{wtx} and
the @code{Program host} to @code{target_ppc}.

Once the debugger is initialized, you can also connect to a remote agent
by using the menu @code{Debug->Debug->Connect to Board...}. This will open
a dialog where you can specify the target name (e.g. the name of your
@cindex board
board or debug agent) and the communication protocol.

In order to load a new module on the target, you can select the menu
@code{Debug->Debug->Load File...}.

If a module has been loaded on the target and is not known
to the current debug session, use the menu
@code{Debug->Debug->Add Symbols...} to load the symbol tables in the current
debugger.

Similarly, if you are running the underlying debugger (gdb) on a remote
machine, you can specify the name of this machine by setting the
@code{Tools host} field of the project properties.

Whether the editor should remove trailing blanks when saving a file.

@item Line terminator
@cindex line terminator
Choose between @i{Unix}, @i{Windows} and @i{Unchanged} line terminators when
saving files. Choosing @i{Unchanged} will use the original line terminator
when saving the file; @i{Unix} will use LF line terminators;
@i{Windows} will use CRLF line terminators.

0 if none.

Each modified file is saved under a file called @code{.#filename}, which is
removed on the next explicit save operation.

@item Column highlight
@cindex column highlight
The column number to highlight and draw in the editors. 0 if none.

@item Ada
@cindex Ada

@table @b
@item Auto indentation
@cindex indentation
How the editor should indent Ada sources.
None means no indentation; Simple means that indentation from the previous
line is used for the next line; Extended means that a language specific
parser is used for indenting sources.

@item Use tabulations
@cindex tabulation
Whether the editor should use tabulations when indenting.

@item Default indentation
@cindex indentation level
The number of spaces for the default Ada indentation.

@item Continuation lines
@cindex continuation line
The number of extra spaces for continuation lines.

@item Declaration lines
@cindex declaration line
The number of extra spaces for multiple line declarations.
For example, using a value of 4, here is how the following code would be
indented:

@cindex example
@smallexample
variable1,
    variable2,
    variable3 : Integer;
@end smallexample

@item RM style case indentation
@cindex case indentation
Whether GPS should indent case statements with an extra level, as used in the
Ada Reference Manual, e.g:

@cindex example
@smallexample
case Value is
   when others =>
      null;
end case;
@end smallexample

If this preference is set to @code{False}, this would be indented as:

@cindex example
@smallexample
case Value is
when others =>
   null;
end case;
@end smallexample

@item Reserved word casing
How the editor should handle reserved words casing.
@code{Unchanged} will keep the casing as-is;
@code{Upper} will change the casing of all reserved words to upper case;
@code{Lower} will change the casing to lower case;
@code{Mixed} will change the casing to mixed case (all characters to
lower case except first character and characters after an underscore
which are set to upper case).
@code{Smart_Mixed} As above but do not force upper case characters to
lower case.

@item Identifier casing
How the editor should handle identifiers casing.
The values are the same as for the @i{Reserved word casing} preference.

@item Format operators/delimiters
Whether the editor should add extra spaces around operators and delimiters
if needed.
If enabled, an extra space will be added when needed in the following cases:
before an opening parenthesis;
after a closing parenthesis, comma, semicolon;
around all Ada operators (e.g. @code{<=}, @code{:=}, @code{=>}, @dots{})

@item Align declarations on colons
Whether the editor should automatically align colons in declarations and
parameter lists. Note that the alignment is computed by taking into account
the current buffer up to the current line (or end of the current selection),
so if declarations continue after the current line, you can select
the declarations lines and hit the reformat key.

@item Align associations on arrows
Whether the editor should automatically align arrows in associations
(e.g. aggregates or function calls). See also previous preference.

@end table

@item C/C++
@cindex C
@cindex C++

@table @b
@item Auto indentation
@cindex indentation

None means no indentation; Simple means that indentation from the previous
line is used for the next line; Extended means that a language specific
parser is used for indenting sources.

@item Use tabulations
@cindex tabulation
Whether the editor should use tabulations when indenting. If True,
the editor will replace each occurrence of eight characters by a tabulation
character.

@item Default indentation
@cindex indentation
The number of spaces for the default indentation.

@end table

@end table

@item @b{Debugger}
@cindex debugger
@table @i
@item General

@table @b
@item Color highlighting
@cindex color
Color used for highlighting in the debugger console.

@item Break on exceptions
@cindex breakpoint
@cindex exception
Specifies whether a breakpoint on all exceptions should be set by
default when loading a program. This setup is only taken into account
when a new debugger is initialized, and will not modify a running
debugger (use the breakpoint editor for running debuggers).

@item Execution window
@cindex execution
@cindex tty
Specifies whether the debugger should create a separate execution window for the
program being debugged.
If true, a separate console will be created. Under Unix systems, this
console is another window in the bottom part of the main window; under
Windows, this is a separate window created by the underlying gdb, since
Windows does not have the notion of separate terminals (aka ttys).

Note that in this mode under Windows, the @code{Debug->Interrupt} menu
will not interrupt the debugged program. Instead, you need to hit
@key{Ctrl-C} in the separate execution window to interrupt it while it is
running.

If false, no execution window will be created. The debugger assumes that the
program being debugged does not require input, or that if it does, input
is handled outside GPS. For example, when you attach to a running process,
this process already has a separate associated terminal.

@item Show lines with code
Specifies whether the source editor should display blue dots for lines
that contain code. If set to @i{False}, gray dots will be displayed instead
on each line, allowing breakpoint on any line. Disabling this option provides
a faster feedback, since GPS does not need to query the debugger about which
lines contain code.

@end table

@item Assembly
@cindex assembly
@table @b
@item Current assembly line
Color used to highlight the assembly code for the current line.

@item Range size
@cindex range size

If @code{a2ps} is not installed on your system, you can download it
from @url{www.inf.enst.fr/~demaille/a2ps}

Under Windows systems, this program is optional and is empty by default, since
a built-in printing is provided. An external tool will be used if specified,
such as the PrintFile freeware utility available from @url{www.lerup.com/printfile/descr.html}

@node The Key Manager Dialog
@section The Key Manager Dialog
@c -----------------------------------------------------------------
@noindent

The key manager is accessible through the menu @code{Edit->Key Shortcuts}.
This dialog provides an easy way to associate key shortcuts with actions.
These actions are either predefined in GPS, or defined in your own
customization files, as documented in @ref{Customizing the Menu and Tool Bar}.
It also provides an easy way to redefine the menu shortcuts.

@iftex
@cindex screen shot
@image{key-shortcuts, 8.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@cindex screen shot
@image{key-shortcuts}
@end ifhtml

Actions are referenced by their name, and are grouped into categories. These
categories indicate when the action applies. For instance, the indentation
command only applies in source editors, whereas the command to change the
current window applies anywhere in GPS.

Through the key manager, you can define key bindings similar to what Emacs
uses (@key{control-x} followed by @key{control-k} for instance). To register
such key bindings, you need to press the @code{Grab} button as usual, and then
type the shortcut. The recording of the key binding will stop a short while
after the last key stroke.

This facility for creating complex shortcuts is not available for menu
items yet.

@end menu

@noindent
You can customize the GPS menu bar in two different ways: you can
redefine or add new key bindings to the existing menu items, and
you can define new menu items.

@subsection Redefining key bindings
@cindex key
@cindex key binding
@anchor{Redefining key bindings}
@noindent
In order to define or redefine key bindings, you first need to enable
the @i{dynamic key binding} feature in the Preferences dialog.
@xref{Dynamic key bindings}.

Then, you can simply navigate through the menus, and type the key binding
you want to associate to a particular item. To remove a key binding, use
the @key{Backspace} key.
Your changes will be saved when GPS exits, in a file called
@file{$HOME/.gps/custom_keys}. In particular, this means that if for some
reason you need to edit the file manually, you need to do it outside of
GPS, or save the file under a different name, and rename it after exiting
GPS.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Customization files
@subsection Customization files
@c ------------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
The GPS menu bar can be customized through XML files. These files are found
through three possible mechanisms, described here in the order in which they
are searched. Files found through @code{GPS_CUSTOM_PATH} or the user's
directory can override any setup found in the system directory. Likewise,
files found in the user's directory can override any file found in the
@code{GPS_CUSTOM_PATH} directories.

@itemize @bullet
@item System wide customization

The @file{INSTALL/share/gps/customize} directory, where
@file{INSTALL} is the name of the GPS installation directory, should contain
the files that will always be loaded whenever GPS is loaded, by any user on
the system

@item @code{GPS_CUSTOM_PATH}

This environment variable can be set before launching GPS. It should contain
a list of directories, separated by semicolons (';') on Windows systems and
colons (':') on Unix systems. All the files found in these directories will
be searched for customization files.

This is a convenient way to have project-specific customization files. You can
for instance create scripts, or icons, that set the appropriate value for the
variable and then start GPS. Depending on your project, this allows you to
load specific aliases which do not make sense for other projects.

@item User directory

The directory @file{$HOME/.gps/customize} on Unix
systems, and @file{%HOME%\.gps\customize} on Windows systems, can also contain
customization files which are parsed at startup. This is a convenient way for
users to define their own customization, that they want to load no matter which
project they are working on.
@end itemize

The format of these files have changed in GPS 1.3.0. A conversion program
is provided that will automatically convert all files in the customization
directory to the new format. This conversion tool is called
@file{gps2custom-1.3}, and must be run manually.

These files must be utf8-encoded by default. However, you can specify any
encoding you wish through the standard @code{<?xml encoding="..." ?>}
declaration, as in the following example:

@smallexample
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1">
<submenu>
  <title>encoded text/title>
</submenu>
@end smallexample

Any given XML file can contain customization for various aspects of GPS, mixing
aliases, new languages or menus,@dots{} in a single file. This is
a convenient way to distribute your customization to other users.

These files must be valid XML files, i.e. must start with the
@code{<?xml?>} tag, and contain a single root XML node, the name of which is
left to your consideration. The general format is therefore

@smallexample
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<root_node>
  ...
</root_node>
@end smallexample

XML comments are not supported in these files.

The list of valid XML child nodes that can be specified under <root> is
described in later sections. This includes:

@table @code

@node Defining Actions
@subsection Defining Actions
@cindex action
@cindex <action>
@cindex <shell>
@cindex <external>
@c -----------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
These files distinguish the actions from their associated menus or
key bindings. These actions can take on several forms: external commands,
shell commands and predefined commands, as will be explained in more details
below.

The general form to define new actions is to use the @code{<action>} tag.
This XML tag requires one attribute, its @code{name}. It can have one or
several children, all of which define a particular command to execute. All
of these commands are executed one after the other, unless one of them
fails in which case the following commands are not executed.

The following XML tags are valid children for @code{<action>}.
@table @code

@cindex external
@item <external>
This defines a command to execute through the system (i.e. a standard Unix or
Windows command)

Note for Windows users: like under UNIX, scripts can be called
from custom menu. In order to do that, you must write your script in a
@file{.bat} or @file{.cmd} file, and call this file using @code{cmd /c}.
Thus, the @code{external} tag would look like:

@smallexample
<action name="my_command">
  <external>cmd /c c:\.gps\my_scripts\my_cmd.cmd</external>
</action>
@end smallexample


@cindex shell
@cindex shell
@cindex interactive command
@item <shell>
As well as external commands, you can use custom menu items to invoke GPS
commands using the @code{shell} tag. These are command written in one of the
shell scripts supported by GPS.
The following example shows how to
create two actions to invoke the @code{help} interactive command and to open
the file @file{main.c}.

@smallexample
<action name="help">
  <shell>help</shell>
</action>
<action name="edit">
  <shell>edit main.c</shell>
</action>
@end smallexample

By default, commands are expected to be written in the GPS shell language.
However, you can specify the language through the @code{lang} attribute. Its
default value is @code{"shell"}.

@ifset python
The value of this attribute could also be "python".
@end ifset

When programming with the GPS shell, you can execute multiple commands
by separating them with semicolons. Therefore, the following example
adds a menu which lists all the files used by the current file, in a
project browser.

@smallexample
<action name="current file uses">
  <shell lang="shell">File %f</shell>
  <shell lang="shell">File.uses %1</shell>
</action>
@end smallexample


@item <description>
@cindex description
This tag contains a description for the command, which is used in the
graphical editor for the key manager. @xref{The Key Manager Dialog}.

@item <context>
@cindex context
This is the name of the context in which the action applies. By default,
actions are applicable anywhere in GPS. You can restrict for instance the
action to the source editors by specifying "Source editor" in this field.
This allows you to have the same key binding defined for multiple actions
but which do not act in the same context.

The list of valid context names can be seen in the
@code{Edit->Key shortcuts} menu dialog.

@end table

It is possible to mix both shell commands and external commands. For
instance, the following command opens an xterm (on Unix systems only)
in the current directory, which depends on the context.

@smallexample
<action "xterm in current directory">
  <shell lang="shell">cd %d</shell>
  <external>xterm</external>
</action>
@end smallexample

As seen in some of the examples above, some special strings are expanded by
GPS just prior to executing the command. These are the "%f", "%d",.. See below
for a full list.

Some actions are also predefined in GPS itself. This include for instance
aliases expansion, manipulating MDI windows,...

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Macro arguments
@subsection Macro arguments
@cindex menu
@cindex argument
@cindex substitution
@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
When an action is defined, you can use macro arguments to pass to your
shell or external commands. Macro arguments
are special parameters that are transformed every time the command is executed.
The following macro arguments are provided:

@table @code
@item %f
Base name of the currently opened file.

@item %F
Absolute name of the currently opened file.

@item %d
The currently directory.

@item %p
The current project. This is the name of the project, not the project file.

@item %P
The root project. This is the name of the project, not the project file.

@item %pp
The current project file pathname.

@item %PP
The root project pathname.

@item %(p|P)[r](d|s)[f]
Substituted by the list of sources or directories of a given project. This list
is a list of space-separated, quoted names (all names are surrounded by double
quotes, for proper handling of spaces in directories or file names).

@table @code
@item P
the root project.

@item p
the selected project, or the root project if there is no project selected.

@item r
recurse through the projects: sub projects will be listed as well as their
sub projects, etc@dots{}

@item d
list the source directories.

@item s
list the source files.

@item f
output the list into a file and substitute the parameter with the
name of that file. This file is never deleted by GPS, it is your responsability
to do so.
@end table

@end table

@cindex example
Examples:

@table @code
@item %Ps
Replaced by a list of source files in the root project.

@item %prs
Replaced by a list of files in the current project, and all imported
sub projects, recursively.

@item %prdf
Replaced by the name of a file that contains a list of source
directories in the current project, and all imported sub projects,
recursively.
@end table


@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Adding new menus
@subsection Adding new menus
@cindex menus
@cindex <menu>
@cindex <submenu>
@cindex <title>
@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
These commands can be associated with menus, tool bar buttons and keys. All
of these use similar syntax.

Binding a menu to an action is done through the @code{<menu>} tag. This tag
requires an @code{action} attribute which specifies which action to execute
when the menu is selected by the user. If no action by this name was defined,
no new menu is added.

It should also have one XML child called @code{<title>} which specifies the
label of the menu
You can define the accelerator keys for your menus, using underscores
in the titles. Thus, if you want an accelerator on the first letter in
a menu named @code{File}, set its title as @code{_File}.

You can specify which menu this new item is added to by putting the
@code{<menu>} tag to a @code{<submenu>} tag. The latter also takes a
@code{<title>} as a child. You can add items or sub menus to existing menus,
using titles for menus that already exist.

For example, this adds an item named @code{mymenu} to the standard
@code{Edit} menu.

@smallexample
<submenu>
  <title>Edit</title>
  <menu action="current file uses">
     <title>mymenu</title>
  </menu>
</submenu>
@end smallexample

Use the @code{/} separator to identify the submenu in a menu. For
example, this adds a new item "stats" to the standard "unit testing" submenu
in "tools".

@smallexample
<submenu>
  <title>Tools/unit testing</title>
  <menu action="execute my stats">
    <title>stats</title>
  </menu>
</submenu>
@end smallexample

Adding an item with an empty title or no title at all inserts a
menu separator.



@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Adding tool bar buttons
@subsection Adding tool bar buttons
@cindex tool bar
@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
As an alternative to creating new menu items, you can create new
buttons on the tool bar, with a similar syntax, by using
the @code{<button>} tag. As for the @code{<menu>} tag, it requires an
@code{action} attribute which specifies what should be done when the button
is pressed. The button is not created if no such action was created.

@cindex jpeg
@cindex png
@cindex gif
@cindex xpm
Within this tag, the tag @code{<pixmap>} can be used to indicate
the location of an image file (of the type @code{jpeg, png, gif}
or @code{xpm}) to be used as icon for the button. An empty
@code{<button>} tag indicates a separator in the tool bar.

A title can also be specified with @code{<title>}. This will be visible only
if the user choses to see both text and icons in the tool bar.

The following example defines a new button:

@smallexample
<button action="execute my stats">
   <title>stats</title>
   <pixmap>/my_pixmaps/button.jpg</pixmap>
</button>
@end smallexample

@subsection Binding actions to keys
@cindex key
@cindex <key>
@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
All the actions defined above can be bound to specific key shortcuts through
the @code{<key>} attribute. As usual, it requires one @code{<action>}
attribute to specify what to do when the key is pressed.

This tag doesn't contain any child tag. Instead, its text contents specified
the keyboard shortcut. The name
of the key can be prefixed by @code{control-}, @code{alt-}, @code{shift-} or
any combination of these to specify the key modifiers to apply.

You can also define multiple key bindings similar to Emacs's by separating them
by a space. For instance, @code{control-x control-k} means that the user should
press @key{control-x}, followed by a @key{control-k} to activate the
corresponding action.

@node Defining new search patterns
@subsection Defining new search patterns
@cindex <vsearch-pattern>
@cindex predefined patterns
@c ----------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
The search dialog contains a number of predefined search patterns for Ada
and C. These are generally complex regular expressions, presented in the dialog
with a more descriptive name. This includes for instance "Ada assignment",
which will match all such assignments.

You can define your own search patterns in the customization files. This is
done through the @code{<vsearch-pattern>} tag. This tag can have a number of
children tags:

@table @code
@item <name>

This tag is the string that is displayed in the search dialog to
represent the new pattern. This is the text that the user will
effectively see, instead of the often hard to understand regular
expression.

@item <regexp>

This tag provides the regular expression to use when the pattern has
been selected by the user. Be careful that you must protect reserved
XML characters such as '<' and replace them by their equivalent
expansion ("&lt;" for this character).

This accepts one optional attribute, named @code{case-sensitive}. This
attribute accepts one of two possible values ("true" or "false") which
indicates whether the search should distinguish lower case and upper
case letters. Its default value is "false".

@item <string>

This tag provides a constant string that should be searched.
Only one of @code{<regexp>} and @code{<string>} should be provided. If
both exists, the first @code{<regep>} child found is used. If there is
none, the first @code{<string>} child is used.

The tag accepts the same optional attribute @code{case-sensitive} as
above
@end table

Here is a small example on how the "Ada assignment" pattern was
defined.

@smallexample
<vsearch-pattern>
  <name>Ada: assignment</name>
  <regexp case-sensitive="false">\b(\w+)\s*:=</regexp>
</vsearch-pattern>
@end smallexample

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
The following example is a full example for one of the files in the
customization directory. The only thing that hasn't been described before is
the first line of the file, which is required to make it a valid XML file.

@smallexample
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<Custom>
  <action name="action1">
    <external>external-command 1</external>
  </action>

  <action name="action2">

    <title>custom menu</title>
    <menu action="action1">

      <submenu>
        (...)
      </submenu>
    </submenu>
  </submenu>
</Custom>
@end smallexample

The example above creates a top-level menu named @code{custom menu}.
This menu contains a menu item named @code{item 1}, which is associated to the
external command @code{external-command 1}, a sub menu named @code{other menu},

@node Adding Support for New Languages
@section Adding Support for New Languages
@cindex <Language>
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
You can define new languages in a custom file by using the @code{Language}
tag. Defining languages gives GPS the ability to highlight the syntax of a
file, explore a file (using e.g. the project explorer), find files
associated with a given language, @dots{}

As described previously for menu items, any file in the @file{customize}
directory will be loaded by GPS at start up. Therefore, you can either
define new languages in a separate file, or reuse a file where you already
define actions and menus.

The following tags are available in a @code{Language} section:

@table @code
@item Name
A short string describing the name of the language.

@item Parent
If set to the name of an existing language (e.g. @code{Ada}, @code{C++}) or
another custom language, this language will inherit by default all its
properties from this language. Any field explicitely defined for this language
will override the inherited settings.

@item Spec_Suffix
A string describing the suffix of spec/definition files for this language.
If the language does not have the notion of spec or definition file, you
can ignore this value.

@item Body_Suffix
A string describing the suffix of body/implementation files for this language.

@item Keywords
A V7 style regular expression for recognizing and highlighting keywords.
Multiple @code{Keywords} tags can be specified, and will be concatenated
into a single regular expression.

The full grammar of the regular expression can be found in the spec of the
file @file{g-regpat.ads} in the GNAT run time.

@item Engine
The name of a dynamic library providing one or several of the functions
described below.

The name can be a full pathname, or a short name. E.g. under most Unix systems
if you specify @code{custom}, GPS will look for @code{libcustom.so} in
the @code{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} run time search path. You can also specify
explicitly e.g. @code{libcustom.so} or @code{/usr/lib/libcustom.so}.

For each of the following five items, GPS will look for the corresponding
symbol in @code{Engine} and if found, will call this symbol when needed.
Otherwise, it will default to the static behavior, as defined by the other
language-related items describing a language.

You will find the required specification for the C and Ada languages
to implement the following functions in the directory
@file{<prefix>/share/gps/doc/examples/language} of your GPS installation.
@file{language_custom.ads} is the Ada spec file; @file{language_custom.h} is
the C spec file; @file{gprcustom.c} is an example file showing a possible
C implementation of the functions @code{Comment_Line} and @code{Uncomment_Line}
for the GPS project files (@file{.gpr} files), or any other Ada-like
language.

@item Comment_Line
Name of a symbol in the specified shared library corresponding to a
function that will comment a line (used to implement the menu
@code{Edit->Comment Lines}).

@item Uncomment_Line
Name of a symbol in the specified shared library corresponding to a
function that will uncomment a line (used to implement the menu
@code{Edit->Uncomment Lines}).

@item Parse_Constructs
Name of a symbol in the specified shared library corresponding to a
function that will parse constructs of a given buffer.

This procedure is used by GPS to implement several capabilities such as
listing constructs in the project explorer, highlighting the current block of
code, going to the next or previous procedure, @dots{}

@item Format_Buffer
Name of a symbol in the specified shared library corresponding to a
function that will indent and format a given buffer.

This procedure is used to implement the auto indentation when hitting the
@key{enter} key, or when using the format key on the current selection or
the current line.

@item Parse_Entities
Name of a symbol in the specified shared library corresponding to a
function that will parse entities (e.g. comments, keywords, @dots{}) of a given
buffer. This procedure is used to highlight the syntax of a file, and
overrides the @code{Context} node described below.

@item Context
Describes the context used to highlight the syntax of a file.

   @table @code
   @item Comment_Start
   A string defining the beginning of a multiple-line comment.

   @item Comment_End
   A string defining the end of a multiple-line comment.

   @item New_Line_Comment_Start
   A string defining the beginning of a single line comment (ended at the next
   end of line).

   @item String_Delimiter
   A character defining the string delimiter.

   @item Quote_Character
   A character defining the quote character, used for e.g. canceling the
   meaning of a string delimiter (@code{\} in C).

   @item Constant_Character
   A character defining the beginning of a character literal.

   @item Can_Indent
   A boolean indicating whether indentation should be enabled for this
   language. The indentation mechanism used will be the same for all languages:
   the number of spaces at the beginning of the current line is used when
   indenting the next line.

   @item Syntax_Highlighting
   A boolean indicating whether the syntax should be highlighted/colorized.

   @item Case_Sensitive
   A boolean indicating whether the language (and in particular the identifiers
   and keywords) is case sensitive.
   @end table

@item Categories
Optional node to describe the categories supported by the project explorer
for the current language. This node contains a list of @code{Category} nodes,
each describing the characteristics of a given category, with the following
nodes:

   @table @code
   @item Name
   Name of the category, which can be one of:
   package, namespace, procedure, function, task, method, constructor,
   destructor, protected, entry,
   class, structure, union, type, subtype, variable, local_variable,
   representation_clause,
   with, use, include,
   loop_statement, case_statement, if_statement, select_statement,
   accept_statement, declare_block, simple_block, exception_handler.

   @item Pattern
   Regular expression used to detect a language category.
   As for the @code{Keywords} node, multiple @code{Pattern} tags can be
   specified and will be concatenated into a single regular expression.

   @item Index
   Index in the pattern used to extract the name of the entity contained in
   this category.
   @end table

@ifset extendedlanguage
@item Project_Field
This tag describes the tools that are used to support this
language. The name of these tools is stored in the project files, and
therefore only a limited number of tools can be specified. Note that this
tag is currently only used by the project properties and wizard, and is
not taken into account by other components.

This node has two attributes:

   @table @code
   @item Name
   Name of the attribute in the project file. Currently, only
   @code{"compiler_command"} can be specified.

   @item Index
   If present, this attributes indicates the index to use for the
   attribute in the project file. The line defining this attribute
   would therefore look like:

   @smallexample
      for Name ("Index") use "value";
   @end smallexample

   e.g:

   @smallexample
      for Compiler_Command ("my_language") use "my_compiler";
   @end smallexample

   The value of the index should be either the empty string or the
   name of the language.

   @end table

The value of this tag is the string to use in the project properties
editor when editing this project field.
@end ifset

@node Defining Text Aliases
@section Defining Text Aliases
@cindex aliases
@cindex <alias>
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
GPS provides a mechanism known as @b{aliases}. These are defined
through the menu @code{Edit->Aliases}.

Each alias has a name, which is generally a short string of characters.
When you type them in any textual entry in GPS (generally a source editor, but
also entry fields for instance in the file selector), and then press the special
activation key (by default @key{control-o}, controlled by a
preference), this name is removed from the source editor, and replaced
by the text you have associated with it.

Alias names may be composed of any character except newlines, but must start
with a letter. GPS will jump to the start of each word before the current
cursor position, and if the characters between this word start and the
cursor position is an alias name, this alias is expanded.

@iftex
@cindex screen shot
@image{aliases, 10.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@cindex screen shot
@image{aliases}
@end ifhtml

The alias editor is divided into three main parts: on the left side, the list of
currently defined aliases is shown. Clicking on any of them will
display the replacement text for this alias. If you click again the
selected alias, GPS displays a text entry which you can use to rename
an existing alias. Alias names must start with a letter. A check
button at the bottom selects whether the read-only aliases
(i.e. system-wide aliases) should be displayed.

The second part is the expansion text for the alias, at the bottom
right corner. This replacement text can used multiple lines, and
contain some special text that act as a special replacement. These
special texts are highlighted in a different color. You can insert
these special entities either by typing them, or by right-clicking in
the editor, and select the entity in the contextual menu.

The following special entities are currently defined:

@table @code
@item %_
This is the position where the cursor should be put once the
replacement text has been inserted in the editor.

@item %(name)
This is the name of a parameter. @i{name} can be any string you want,
excluding closing parenthesis. See below for more information on
parameters.

@item %D
This is the current date, in ISO format. The year is displayed first,
then the month and the day

@item %H
This is the current time (hour, minutes and seconds)

@item %l
If the expansion of the alias is done in a source editor, this is the
line on which the cursor is when pressing @key{control-o}.

@item %c
This is similar to @i{%l}, except it returns the current column.

@item %f
If the expansion is done in a source editor, this is the name of the
current file (its base name only, this doesn't include the directory)

@item %d
If the expansion is done in a source editor, this is the directory in
which the current file is

@item %p
If the expansion is done in a source editor, this is the base name of
the project file to which the file belongs.

@item %P
If the expansion is done in a source editor, this is the full path
name to the project file (directory and base name).

@item %O
Used for recursive aliases expansion. This special character will expand
the text seen before it in the current alias, after replacement of the
parameters and possibly other recursive expansions. This is similar to pressing
@key{control-o} (or any key you have defined for alias expansion) in the
expanded form of the alias.

You cannot expand an alias recursively when already expanding that alias. For
instance, if the alias expansion for @i{procedure} contains @i{procedure%O},
the inner procedure will not be expanded.

@end table

The indentation as set in the expansion of the alias is preserved when
the alias is expanded. All the lines will be indented the same amount
to the right as the alias name.

The third part of the aliases editor, at the top right corner, lists
the parameters for the currently selected alias. Any time you insert a
@i{%(name)} string in the expansion text, GPS automatically detects
there is a new parameter reference (or an old reference has changed
name or was removed); the list of parameters is automatically updated
to show the current list.

Each parameters has three attributes:

@table @b
@item name
This is the name you use in the expansion text of the alias in the
@i{%(name)} special entity.

@item Environment
This specifies whether the default value of the parameter comes from
the list of environment variables set before GPS was started.

@item default value
Instead of getting the default value from the environment variable,
you can also specify a fixed text.
Clicking on the initial value of the currently selected variable opens
a text entry which you can use to edit this default value.

@end table

When an alias that contains parameters is expanded, GPS will first
display a dialog to ask for the value of the parameters. You can
interactively enter this value, which replaces all the @i{%(name)}
entities in the expansion text.


@subsection Aliases files

@noindent
The customization files described earlier can also contain aliases
definition. This can be used for instance to create project or system wide
aliases. All the customization files will be parsed to look for aliases
definition.

However, all these customization files are considered as read-only by GPS,
and therefore cannot be edited through the graphical interface. It is
possible to override some of the aliases in your own custom files.

There is one specific files, which must contain only aliases definition. This
is the file @file{$HOME/.gps/aliases}. Whenever you edit aliases graphically,
or create new ones, they are stored in this file, which is the only one that
GPS will ever modify automatically.

The system files are loaded first, and aliases defined in them can be
overriden by the user-defined file.

These files are standard customization files, @xref{Customization files}.
The specific XML tag to use is @i{<alias>}, one per new alias.
The following example contains a standalone customization file, but you might
wish to merge the @i{<alias>} tag in any other customization file.

The following tags are available:

@table @code
@item alias
This indicates the start of a new alias. It has one mandatory
attribute, @code{name}, which the text to type in the source editor
before pressing @key{control-o}.

@item param
These are children of the @code{alias} node. There is one per
parameter of the alias. They have one mandatory attribute,
@code{name}, which is the name to type between @i{%(name)} in the
alias expansion text.

They have one optional attribute, @code{environment}, which indicates
the default value must be read from the environment variables if it is
set to true.

These tags contain text, which is the default value for the parameter.

@item text
This is a child of the @code{alias} node, whose value is the
replacement text for the alias.
@end table

Here is an example of an alias file:

@smallexample
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<Aliases>
  <alias name="proc" >
    <param name="p" >Proc1</param>
    <param environment="true" name="env" />
    <text>procedure %(p) is
%(env)%_
end %(p);</text>
  </alias>
</Aliases>

@node Adding support for new tools
@section Adding support for new tools
@cindex external tool
@cindex <tool>
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
Support for external tools can be provided through GPS. Typically, this
would be done to specify different compilers, but it can also apply to a wide
variety of tools.

GPS's support for external tools is enhancing with each release. Typically,
the following things need to be achieved to successfully use a tool:

@itemize @bullet
@item Specify its command line switches
@item Pass it the appropriate arguments depending on the current context, or
      on user input
@item Spawn the tool
@item Optionally parse its result and act accordingly
@end itemize

Each of these points is discussed in further sections. In all these cases, most
of the work can be done statically through XML customization files.
These files have the same format as other customization files
(@pxref{Customization files}), and the tool descriptions are found in
@code{<tool>} tags.

This tag accepts the following attributes:

@table @code
@item name (mandatory)
This is the name of the tool. This is purely descriptive, and will appear
throughout the GPS interface whenever this tool is referenced. This includes
for instances the tabs of the switches editor.

@item package (Default value is ide)
This optional attribute specifies which package should be used in the project
to store information about this tool, in particular its switches. You cannot
create new packages as you wish, and must use only existing packages. Most of
the time the default value should be used, unless you are working with one of
the predefined packages;

If this attribute is set to "ide", then the switches cannot be set for a
specific file, only at the project level. Support for file-specific switches
currently requires modification of the GPS sources themselves.

@item index (Default value is the tool name)
This optional attribute specifies what index is used in the project. This is
mostly for internal use by GPS, and describes what index of the
@code{Default_Switches} attribute is used to store the switches for that tool.

@end table

This tag accepts the following children, described in separate sections:

@table @code
@item <switches>
   (@pxref{Defining tool switches})
@item <language>

If no language is specified, the tool applies to all languages. In particular,
the switches editor page will be displayed for all languages, no matter what
languages they support.

If at least one language is specified, the switches editor page will only be
displayed if that language is supported by the project.

@noindent
The user has to be able to specify which tools should be used when working
with the tool. If the tool is simply called through custom menus, you might
want to hard code some or all of the switches. However, in the general case
it is better to use the project properties editor, so that project-specific
switches can be specified.

This is what GPS does by default for Ada, C and C++. You can find in the GPS
installation how the switches for these languages are defined in an XML file.
These provide extended examples of the use of customization files.

This switches editor provides a powerful interface to the command line, where
the user can edit the command line both as text and through GUI widgets.

The switches are declared through the @code{<switches>} tag in the
customization file, which must be a child of a @code{<tool>} tag as described
above.

This @code{<switches>} tag accepts the following attributes:

@table @code
@item lines (default value is 1)
The switches in the project properties editor are organized into boxes,
each surrounded by a frame, optionally with a title. This attribute specifies
the number of rows of such frames.

@item columns (default value is 1)
This attribute specifies the number of columns of frames in the project
properties page.
@end table

This @code{<switches>} tag can have any number of child tag, among the
following. They can be repeated multiple times if you need several check boxes.
For consistency, most of these child tags accept attributes among the
following:

@table @code
@item line (default value is 1)
This indicates the row of the frame that should contain the switch. See the
description of @code{lines} above.

@item line-span (default value is 1)
This indicates how many rows the frame should span. If this is set to 0, then
the frame is hidden from the user. See for instance the Ada or C switches
editor.

@item column (default value is 1)
This indicates the column of the frame that should contain the switch. See the
description of @code{columns} above.

@item column-span (default value is 1)
This indicates how many columns the frame should span. If this is set to 0,
then the frame is hidden from the user. See for instance the Ada or C
switches editor.

@item label
This is the label which is displayed in the graphical interface

@item switch
This is the text that should be put on the command line if that switch is
selected. Depending on its type, a variant of the text might be put instead,
see the description of @code{combo} and @code{spin} below.
This switch shouldn't contain any space.

@item tip (default value is empty)
This is the tooltip which describes that switch more extensively. It is
displayed in a small popup window if the user leaves the mouse on top of
the widget.

@item min (default value is 1)
This attribute is used for @code{<spin>} tags, and indicates the minimum
value authorized for that switch.

@item max (default value is 1)
This attribute is used for @code{<spin>} tags, and indicates the maximum
value authorized for that switch.

@item default (default value is 1)
This attribute is used for @code{<spin>} tags. See the description below.

@item noswitch (default is empty)
This attribute is only valid for @code{<combo>} tags, and described below.

@item nodigit (default is empty)
This attribute is only valid for @code{<combo>} tags, and described below.

@item value (mandatory)
This attribute is only valid for @code{<combo-entry>} tags.

@end table

Here are the valid children for @code{<switches>}:

@table @code
@item <title>
This tag, which accepts the @code{line}, @code{column}, @code{line-span} and
@code{column-span} attributes, is used to give a name to a specific frame.
The value of the attribute is the title itself. You do not have to specify
a name, and this can be left to an empty value.

@item <check>
This tag accepts the @code{line}, @code{column}, @code{label}, @code{switch}
and @code{tip} attributes. It creates a toggle button. When the latter is
active, the text defined in the switch attribute is added as is
to the command line. This tag doesn't have any value or child tags.

@item <spin>
This tag acceps the @code{line}, @code{column}, @code{label}, @code{switch},
@code{tip}, @code{min}, @code{max} and @code{default} attributes.
This switch will add the contents of the @code{switch} attribute followed by
the current numeric value of the widget to the command line. This is typically
used to indicate indentation length for instance.
If the current value of the widget is equal to the @code{default} attribute,
then nothing is added to the command line.

@item <radio>
This tag accepts the @code{line} and @code{column} attributes. It groups any
number of children, each of which is associated with its own switch. However,
only one of the children can be selected at any given time.

The children must have the tag @code{radio-entry}. This tag accepts the
attributes @code{label}, @code{switch} and @code{tip}.

@item <combo>
This tags accepts the @code{line}, @code{column}, @code{label}, @code{switch},
@code{tip}, @code{noswitch} and @code{nodigit} attributes.

The text inserted in the command line is the text from the @code{switch}
attribute, concatenated with the text of the @code{value} attribute for the
currently selected entry. If the value of the current entry is the same
as that of the @code{nodigit} attribute, then only the text of the
@code{switch} attribute is put on the command line. This is in fact necessary
to interpret the gcc switch "-O" as "-O1".

If the value of the current entry is that of the @code{noswitch} attribute,
then nothing is put in the command line.

The tag @code{<combo>} accepts any number of @code{combo-entry} children tags,
each of which accepts the @code{label} and @code{value} attribute.

@item <popup>
This tag accepts the @code{line}, @code{column}, @code{label}, @code{lines}
and @code{columns} attributes. This displays a simply button that, when
clicked, displays a dialog with some extra switches. This dialog, just as the
switches editor itself, is organizes into lines and columns of frames, the
number of which is provided by the @code{lines} and @code{columns} attributes.

This tag accepts any number of children, which are the same as the
@code{<switches>} attribute itself.

@item <dependency>
This tag is used to describe a relationship between two switches. It is used
for instance when the "Debug Information" switch is selected for "Make", which
forces it for the Ada compiler as well.

It has its own set of attributes:

   @table @code
   @item master-page master-switch
   These two attributes define the switch that possibly forces a specific
   setting on the slave switch. In our example, they would have the values
   "Make" and "-g".

   @item slave-page slave-switch
   These two attributes define the switch which is acted upon by the master
   switch. In our example, they would have the values "Ada" and "-g".

   @item master-status slave-status
   These two switches indicate which state of the master switch forces which
   state of the slave-status. In our example, they would have the values
   "on" and "on", so that when the make debug information is activated, the
   compiler debug information is also activated. However, if the make debug
   information is not activated, no specific setup is forced for the compiler
   debug information.
   @end table

@item <expansion>
This tag is used to describe how switches can be grouped together on the
command line to keep it shorter. It is also used to define aliases between
switches.

It is easier to explain it through an example. Specifying the GNAT switch
"-gnaty" is equivalent to specifying "-gnatyabcefhiklmnprst". This is in
fact a style check switch, with a number of default values. But it is also
equivalent to decomposing it into several switches, as in "-gnatya",
"-gnaty3", "-gnatyb",@dots{} With this information, GPS will try to keep the
command line length as short as possible, to keep it readable.

Both these aspects are defined in a unique @code{<expansion>} tag, which
accepts two attributes: @code{switch} is mandatory, and @code{alias} is
optional. Alias contains the text "gnatyabcefhiklmnprst" in our example.

It also accepts any number of @code{<entry>} children, each has a mandatory
@code{switch} access. The set of all these children define the expanded
equivalent of the switch. In our example, we need one @code{<entry>} child
for "'gnaty3", one for "-gnatya",@dots{}.

@node Executing external tools
@subsection Executing external tools
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
The user has now specified the default switches he wants to use for the
external tool. Spawning the external tool can be done in two ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item From a menu
@item As a result of a key press
@end itemize

Both cases are described in an XML customization file, as described previously,
and both are setup to execute what GPS calls an action, i.e. a set of commands
defined by the @code{<action>} tag.

@subsubsection Chaining commands

This action tag, as described previously, executes one or more commands, which
can either be internal GPS commands (written in any of the scripting language
supported by GPS), or external commands provided by executables found on the
PATH.

The command line for each of these commands can either be hard-coded in the
customization file, or be the result of previous commands executed as part of
the same action. As GPS executes each command from the action in turn, it
saves its output on a stack as needed. If a command line contains a special
construct @code{%1}, @code{%2},@dots{} then these constructs will be replaced
by the result of resp. the last command executed, the previous from last
command, and so on.

Every time you execute a new command, it pushes the previous %1, %2,@dots{}
parameters one step, so that they become resp. %2, %3,@dots{} and the output
of that command becomes %1.

The output of the previous commands is substituted exactly as is. However, if
the output is surrounded by quotes, they are ignored when substitution takes
place, so you need to put them back if they are needed. The reason for this
behavior is so that for scripting languages that systematically protect their
output with quotes (simple or double), these quotes are sometimes in the
way when calling external commands.

@ifset python
@smallexample
<action name="test quotes">
  <shell lang="python">'-a -b -c'</shell>
  <external> echo with quotes: "%1"</external>
  <external> echo without quotes: %2</external/>
</action>
@end smallexample
@end ifset

If one of the commands in the action raises an error, the execution of the
action is stopped immediately, and no further command is performed.


@subsubsection Saving open windows

@cindex save_all
Before launching the external tool, you might want to force GPS to save all
open files, the project,@dots{}. This is done using the same command GPS itself
uses before starting a compilation. This command is called @code{save_all},
and takes one optional argument which specifies whether an interactive dialog
should be displayed for the user.

Since this command aborts when the user presses cancel, you can
simply put it in its own @code{<shell>} command, as in:

@ifset python
@smallexample
<action name="test save children">
  <shell lang="python">GPS.save_all (force=0)</shell>
  <external>echo Run unless Cancel was pressed</external>
</action>
@end smallexample
@end ifset

@ifclear python
@smallexample
<action name="test save children">
  <shell>save_all</shell>
  <external>echo Run unless Cancel was pressed</external>
</action>
@end smallexample
@end ifclear


@subsubsection Querying switches from the project
@cindex get_tool_switches_as_string
@cindex get_tool_switches_as_list
@cindex get_attribute_as_string
@cindex get_attribute_as_list

Some GPS shell commands can be used to query the default switches set by the
user in the project file. These are @code{get_tool_switches_as_string},
@code{get_tool_switches_as_list}, or, more generally,
@code{get_attribute_as_string} and @code{get_attribute_as_list}. The first
two require a unique parameter which is the name of the tool as specified in
the @code{<tool>} tag. This name is case-sensitive. The last two commands are
more general and can be used to query the status of any attribute from the
project. See their description by typing the following in the GPS shell
console window:

@smallexample
help Project.get_attribute_as_string
help Project.get_attribute_as_list
@end smallexample

The following is a short example on how to query the switches for the tool
"Find" from the project, @xref{Full tool example}. It first creates an object
representing the current project, then passes this object as the first
argument of the @code{get_tool_switches_as_string} command. The last external
command is a simple output of these switches

@smallexample
<action name="Get switches for Find">
  <shell>Project %p</shell>
  <shell>Project.get_tool_switches_as_string %1 Find </shell>
  <external>echo %1</external>
</action>
@end smallexample

@ifset python
The following example shows how something similar can be done from Python, in
a simpler manner. For a change, this function queries the Ada compiler
switches for the current project, and prints them out in the messages
window. The

@smallexample
<action name="Query compiler switches">
  <shell lang="python">GPS.Project("%p").get_attribute_as_list
    (package="compiler", attribute="default_switches", index="ada")</shell>
  <external> echo compiler switches= %1</external>
</action>
@end smallexample
@end ifset


@subsubsection Querying switches interactively
@cindex input_dialog
@cindex yes_no_dialog

Another solution to query the arguments for the tool is to ask the user
interactively.
The scripting languages provides a number of solutions for these.

They generally have their own native way to read input, possibly by creating
a dialog.

In addition, the simplest solution is to use the predefined GPS commands for
this. These include two main functions:

@table @code
@item yes_no_dialog
This function takes a single argument, which is a question to display. Two
buttons are then available to the user, "Yes" and "No". The result of this
function is the button the user has selected, as a boolean value.

@item input_dialog
This function is more general. It takes a minimum of two arguments, with no
upper limit. The first argument is a message describing what input is expected
from the user. The second, third and following arguments each correspond to
an entry line in the dialog, to query one specific value (as a string). The
result of this function is a list of strings, each corresponding to these
arguments.

From the GPS shell, it is only convenient to query one value at a time, since
it doesn't have support for lists, and would return a concatenation of the
values. However, this function is especially useful with other scripting
languages.
@end table

@ifset python
The following is a short example that queries the name of a directory and a
file name, and displays each in the Messages window.

@smallexample
<action name="query file and dir">
  <shell lang="python">list=GPS.input_dialog (
     "Please enter directory and file name", "Directory", "File");
     print ("Dir=" + list[0], "File=" + list[1])
  </shell>
</action>
@end smallexample

@end ifset

This section provides an example that defines a new tool. This is only a short
example, since Ada, C and C++ support themselves are provided through such
a file, available in the GPS installation.

This example adds support for the "find" Unix utility, with a few switches. All
these switches are editable through the project properties editor.

It also adds a new action and menu. The action associated with this menu gets
the default switches from the currently selected project, and then ask the
user interactively for the name of the file to search.

@smallexample
<tool name="Find" >
  <switches columns="2" >
    <title column="1" >Filters</title>

@node Defining New Styles and Key Bindings
@section Defining New Styles and Key Bindings
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------------

@cindex Gtk+
@cindex gtkrc
@cindex resource file
@cindex Unix
@noindent
In addition to the GPS specific mechnisms described previousely, GPS can be
configured through the low level Gtk+ mechanism of @file{RC files}.

As more customization capabilities are added in GPS, this mechanism will
become less useful and built-in GPS capabilities should be prefered.

You can create a text file called
@file{gtkrc} in the gps home directory (@file{~/.gps} on Unix systems), or as
a global change, in the directory etc/gps in the GPS installation.

This file follows the Gtk+ resource file syntax and gives the possibility in
particular to define a number of styles and key bindings and attach them to
particular visual objects such as text editors, menu items, @dots{}

For example, you can set @key{Ctrl-v} in the source editors to scroll forward
one page. The following code defines this new key binding:

@cindex example
@smallexample

# Create new key bindings for text editors
binding "custom-text-key"
@{
   # define Ctrl-v to scroll forward one page
   bind "<ctrl>v" @{ "move-cursor" (pages, 1, 0) @}
@}

# Associate the new binding created above with text editors
class "GtkTextView" binding "custom-text-key"

@end smallexample

@subsection Toplevel declarations
@noindent
An RC file is a text file which is composed of a sequence of declarations.
All the literals are case sensitive;
@code{#} characters delimit comments and the portion of a line after a
@code{#} is ignored when parsing an RC file.
The syntax of the top level declarations is described below.
Opening/closing brackets on the same line (@{ ... @}) are used to represent
a sequence of 0 or more elements. Brackets on their own line are real bracket
characters.

@smallexample
toplevel-declarations ::=
   @{ declaration @}

declaration ::=
   include-file | pixmap-path | style-definition | binding-definition |
   enable-resource

include-file ::=
   @b{include} string_literal

pixmap-path ::=
   @b{pixmap_path} string_literal

style-definition ::=
   @b{style} resource-name [ = parent ]
   @{
      sequence-of-style
   @}

binding-definition ::=
   @b{binding} resource-name
   @{
      sequence-of-binding
   @}

enable-resource ::=
   @b{class} "widget-name" (@b{binding} | @b{style}) resource-name

resource-name ::=
   string_literal

@end smallexample

@noindent
The table below describes the meaning of each of these toplevel declarations:

@table @command
@item include @i{filename}
Parses another file at this point. If filename is not an absolute filename, it
is searched in the directories of the currently open RC file.

@item pixmap_path @i{path}
Sets a path (a list of directories separated by colons) that will be searched
for pixmaps referenced in RC files.

@item style @i{name} [ = @i{parent} ] @{ ... @}
Declares a style. If @i{parent} is specified, @i{name} inherits its
default attributes from @i{parent}. You can specify @i{"default"} to designate
the default style, e.g:

@smallexample
style "my-style" = "default" @{ ... @}
@end smallexample

See @ref{Defining new styles} for more details.

@item binding name @{ ... @}
Declares a binding set.
See @ref{Defining new key bindings} for more details.

@item class @i{widget-name} (binding | style) @i{name}
Specifies a binding or style set for a particular set of visual objects.

@item resource-name
An arbitrary user defined name.

@end table

@subsection Defining new styles
@anchor{Defining new styles}
@noindent
A RC style is specified by a style declaration in a RC file, and then bound to
visual objects with a class declaration.
Within each type of declaration, later declarations override earlier ones.

For example, the following code will change the background color of any button,
when it is pressed. It will also set a background pixmap when it is not
pressed. The style also inherits from the one above, so that the buttons also
use the default font.

@cindex example
@smallexample

pixmap_path "@i{directory_that_contains_the_pixmap}"
style "custom-button" = "default"
@{
  bg_pixmap[NORMAL]="@i{pixmap_file}"
  bg[ACTIVE]="blue"
@}
class "GtkButton" style "custom-button"

@end smallexample

@noindent
Here is the syntax for defining styles:

@smallexample

sequence-of-style ::=
   @{ style | property @}

style ::=
   style-name[state] = string_literal

style-name ::=
   @i{bg | fg | base | text | bg_pixmap | font_name}

state ::=
   @i{NORMAL | ACTIVE | PRELIGHT | SELECTED | INSENSITIVE}

property ::=
   widget-name::widget-property = value

widget-property ::=
   @i{cursor-aspect-ratio | cursor-color }

@end smallexample

@noindent
The table below describes the meaning of each of these elements:

@table @command
@item bg[@i{state}] = @i{color}
Sets the color used for the background of most visual objects.

@item fg[@i{state}] = @i{color}
Sets the color used for the foreground of most visual objects.

@item base[@i{state}] = @i{color}
Sets the color used for foreground of visual objects displaying editable
text (e.g. source editors), using base for the background color.

@item text[@i{state}] = @i{color}
Sets the color used for the background of visual objects displaying editable
text, for instance the text editor in GPS.

@item bg_pixmap[@i{state}] = @i{pixmap}
Sets a background pixmap to be used in place of the bg color. The special
value @i{"<parent>"} may be used to indicate that the visual object should use
the same background pixmap as its parent. The special value @i{"<none>"} may be
used to indicate no background pixmap.

@item font_name = @i{font}
Sets the font for a visual object.
Font is a font name as listed in the font selector in the preferences dialog,
e.g. @i{"Sans Italic 10"}.

@item GtkTextView::cursor-aspect-ratio = @i{value}
Width ratio with which to draw the insertion cursor. @i{Value} is a float value
between 0.0 and 1.0. The default value is 0.04.

@item GtkTextView::cursor-color = @i{color}
Color with which to draw insertion cursor

@end table

@noindent
The colors and background pixmaps are specified as a function of the state of
the visual object. The states are:

@table @command
@item NORMAL
A color used for a visual object in its normal state.

@item ACTIVE
A variant of the NORMAL color used when the visual object is in the active
state, and also for the trough of a ScrollBar, tabs of a
NoteBook other than the current tab and similar areas. Frequently, this should
be a darker variant of the NORMAL color.

@item PRELIGHT
A color used for visual objects in the PRELIGHT state. This state is
used for Buttons and MenuItems that have the mouse cursor over them, and for
their children.

@item SELECTED
A color used to highlight data selected by the user. For instance, the
selected items in a list object, and the selection in an editable object.

@item INSENSITIVE
A color used for the background of visual objects that have been set
insensitive.
@end table

Colors can be specified as a string containing a color name (under Unix
systems, GTK+ knows all names from the X color database /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt),
in one of the hexadecimal forms @code{#rrrrggggbbbb}, @code{#rrrgggbbb},
@code{#rrggbb}, or @code{#rgb}, where r, g and b
are hex digits, or they can be specified as a triplet @code{@{r, g, b@}}, where
r, g and b are either integers in the range 0-65535 or floats in the range
0.0-1.0.

@node Scripts
@subsection Scripts

@noindent
Scripts are small programs that interact with GPS and allow you to
perform complex tasks repetitively and easily. GPS includes support
for two scripting languages currently, although additional languages
might be added in the future. These two languages are described in the
following section.

Support for scripting is currently work in progress in GPS. As a
result, not many commands are currently exported by GPS, although
their number is increasing daily. These commands are similar to what
is available to people who extend GPS directly in Ada, but with a
strong advantage: they do not require any recompilation of the GPS
core, and can be tested and executed interactively.

The goal of such scripts is to be able to help automate processes such
as builds, automatic generation of graphs,@dots{}

These languages all have a separate console associated with them,
which you can open from the @code{Tools} menu. In each of these
console, GPS will display a prompt, at which you can type interactive
commands. These console provide completion of the command names
through the @key{tab} key.

For instance, in the GPS shell console you can start typing
@smallexample
GPS> File
@end smallexample

then press the @key{tab} key, which will list all the functions whose
name starts with "File".

@ifset python
A similar feature is available in the python console, which also
provides completion for all the standard python commands and modules.
@end ifset

All the scripting languages share the same set of commands exported by
GPS, thanks to a abstract interface defined in the GPS core. As a
result, GPS modules do not have to be modified when new scripting
languages are added.

@cindex --load
Scripts can be executed immediately upon startup of GPS by using the
command line switch @code{--load}. Specifying the following command
line:

@smallexample
gps --load=shell:mytest.gps
@end smallexample

will force the gps script @file{mytest.gps} to be executed
immediately, before GPS starts reacting to user's requests. This is
useful if you want to do some special initializations of the
environment. It can also be used as a command line interface to GPS,
if you script's last command is to exit GPS.

@cindex --eval
In-line commands can also be given directly on the command line through
@code{--eval} command line switch.

For instance, if you want to analyze an entity in the entity browser
from the command line, you would pass the following command switches:

@smallexample
gps --eval=shell:'Entity entity_name file_name; Entity.show %1'
@end smallexample

See the section @ref{Customizing the Menu and Tool Bar} on how to bind key
shortcuts to shell commands.


@node Scripts and GPS actions
@subsection Scripts and GPS actions
@cindex execute_action

@noindent
There is a strong relationship between GPS actions, as defined in the
customization files, and scripting languages.

Actions can be bound to menus and keys through the customization files or
the @code{Edit->Key shortcuts} dialog.

These actions can execute any script command, @xref{Defining Actions}. This is
done through the @code{<shell>} XML tag.

But the opposite is also true. From a script, you can execute any action
registered in GPS. This can for instance be used to split windows, highlight
lines in the editor,@dots{} when no equivalent shell function exists. This can
also be used to execute external commands, if the scripting language doesn't
support this in an easy manner.

Such calls are made through a call to @code{execute_action}, as in the
following example:

@smallexample
execute_action "Split horizontally"
@end smallexample

@ifset python
@smallexample
GPS.execute_action (action="Split horizontally")
@end smallexample
@end ifset

The list of actions known to GPS can be found through the
@code{Edit->Key shortcuts} dialog. Action names are case sensitive.


@node The GPS Shell
@subsection The GPS Shell
@cindex gps shell

@noindent
The GPS shell is a very simple-minded, line-oriented language. It is
accessible through the @code{Shell} window at the bottom of the GPS
window. It is similar to a Unix shell, or a command window on Windows
systems.

Type @code{help} at the prompt to get the list of available commands,
or @code{help} followed by the name of a command to get more
information on that specific command.

The following example shows how to get some information on a source
entity, and find all references to this entity in the application. It
searches for the entity "entity_name", which has at least one
reference anywhere in the file "file_name.adb". After the first
command, GPS returns an identifier for this entity, which can be used
for all commands that need an entity as a parameter, as is the case
for the second command. When run, the second command will
automatically display all matching references in the location window.

@smallexample
GPS> Entity my_entity file_name.adb
<Entity_0x09055790>
GPS> Entity.find_all_refs <Entity_0x09055790>
@end smallexample

Since the GPS shell is very simple, it doesn't provide any reference
counting for the result types. As a result, all the values returned by
a command, such as @code{<Entity_0x09055790>} in the example above,
are kept in memory.

@cindex clear_cache command
The GPS shell provides the command @code{clear_cache} which removes
all such values from the memory. After this command is run, you can no
longer use references obtained from previous commands, although of
course you can run these commands again to get a new reference.


The return value of the 9 previous commands can easily be recalled by
passing @code{%1}, @code{%2},@dots{} on the command line. For instance,
the previous example could be rewritten as

@smallexample
GPS> Entity my_entity file_name.adb
<Entity_0x09055790>
GPS> Entity.find_all_refs %1
@end smallexample

These return values will be modified also for internal commands sent
by GPS, so you should really only use this when you emit multiple
commands at the same time, and don't do any other action in GPS. This
is mostly useful when used for command-line scripts (see @code{--eval}
and @code{--load}), or for custom files, @xref{Customizing the Menu
and Tool Bar}.

@ifclear python
In future versions of GPS, it will be possible to use more advanced scripting
languages such as @code{Python}.
@end ifclear

@ifset python
@node The Python Interpreter
@subsection The Python Interpreter
@cindex python
@noindent

Python is an interpreted object-oriented language, created by Guido
Van Rossum. It is similar in its capabilities to languages such as
Perl, Tcl or Lisp. This section is not a tutorial on python
programming. See @url{http://www.python.org/doc/current/} to access the
documentation for the current version of python.

If python support has been enabled, the python shell is accessible through the
@code{Python} window at the bottom of the GPS window. You can also
display it by using the menu @file{Tools->Python Console}.

You can type @code{help(GPS)} in the python console to see the list of
functions exported by GPS to python. This list is also given in
@ref{Python Commands}.

The same example that was used to show the GPS shell follows, now using
python. As you can notice, the name of the commands is
similar, although they are not run exactly in the same
way. Specifically, GPS benefits from the object-oriented aspects of
python to create classes and instances of these classes.

In the first line, a new instance of the class Entity is created
through the @code{create_entity} function. Various methods can then be
applied to that instance, including @code{find_all_refs}, which lists
all references to that entity in the location window:

@smallexample
>>> e=GPS.Entity ("entity_name", "file_name.adb")
>>> e.find_all_refs()
@end smallexample

The screen representation of the classes exported by GPS to python has
been modified, so that most GPS functions will return an instance of a
class, but still display their output in a user-readable manner.

Python has extensive introspection capabilities. Continuing the
previous example, you can find what class @code{e} is an instance of
with the following command:

@smallexample
>>> help(e)
Help on instance of Entity:

<GPS.Entity instance>
@end smallexample

It is also possible to find all attributes and methods that can be
applied to @code{e}, as in the following example:

@smallexample
>>> dir (e)
['__doc__', '__gps_data__', '__module__', 'called_by', 'calls',
'find_all_refs']
@end smallexample

Note that the list of methods may vary depending on what modules were
loaded in GPS, since each module can add its own methods to any class.

In addition, the list of all existing modules and objects currently known
in the interpreter can be found with the following command:

@smallexample
>>> dir ()
['GPS', 'GPSStdout', '__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__', 'e', 'sys']
@end smallexample

You can also load and execute python scripts with the @code{execfile} command,
as in the following example:

@smallexample
>>> execfile ("test.py")
@end smallexample

Python supports named parameters. Most functions exported by GPS define
names for their parameters, so that you can use this Python feature, and
make your scripts more readable. A notable exception to this rule are the
functions that take a variable number of parameters.
Using named parameters allows you to specify the parameters in any order
you wish, e.g:

@smallexample
>>> e=GPS.Entity (name="foo", file="file.adb")
@end smallexample

@subsubsection Python modules

On startup, GPS will automatically import (with python's @code{import}
command) all the files with the extension @file{.py} found in the directory
@file{$HOME/.gps/python_startup}. These files are loaded only after all
standard GPS modules have been loaded, as well as the custom files, but
before the script file or batch commands specified on the command lines
with the @code{--eval} or @code{--load} switches.

As a result, one can use the usual GPS functions exported to python in these
startup scripts. Likewise, the script run from the command line can use
functions defined in the startup files.

Since the @code{import} command is used, the functions defined in this
modules will only be accessible by prefixing their name by the name of the
file in which they are defined. For instance if a file @file{mystartup.py}
is copied to the startup directory, and defines the function @code{func},
then the latter will be accessible in GPS through @code{mystartup.func}.

If you are writing a set of python scripts that other people will use,
you need to provide several things:

@itemize
@item The python files themselves. This is a set of @file{.py} files, which
 the user should install either in his @file{python_startup} directory.

@item An XML file with the format described in the customization section
 of this documentation. This XML file should create a series of actions,
 through the @code{<action>} tag, exported to the user. This allows him
 to either create menus to execute these commands or to bind them to special
 key shortcuts
@end itemize

Alternatively, your python script can call the command
@code{GPS.add_xml_customization} to specify some inline XML tags to
interpret. These tag can directly the new menus or key bindings associated
with your command.

The following example defines a python command that inserts a line full of
dashes ('-') at the current cursor location. This command is associated with
the keybinding @key{control-c n}, and can be distributed as a single XML
file.

@smallexample
# This code must be stored in a file test.py in $HOME/.gps/python_startup
from GPS import *

def add_dashes_line():
   replace_text (current_context().file().name(),
                 current_context().location().line(),
                 current_context().location().column(),
                 "--------------------------------", 0, 0)
add_xml_customization ("""
   <action name="dashes line">
      <shell lang="python">test.add_dashes_line()</shell>
      <context>Source editor</context>
   </action>
   <key action="dashes line">control-c n</key>
""")

@noindent
This section addresses some common problems that may arise when using or
installing GPS.

@table @samp

@item Non-privileged users cannot start GPS
Q: I have installed GPS originally as super user, and ran GPS successfully,
but normal users can't.

A: You should check the permissions of the directory $HOME/.gps and its
subdirectories, they should be owned by the user.

@item GPS crashes whenever I open a source editor
This is usually due to font problems. Editing the file
@file{$HOME/.gps/preferences} and changing the name of the fonts, e.g
changing @i{Courier} by @i{Courier Medium}, and @i{Helvetica} by @i{Sans}
should solve the problem.

@item GPS refuses to start the debugger
@cindex debugger
If GPS cannot properly initialize the debugger (using the menu
@code{Debug->Initialize}), it is usually because the underlying debugger
(gdb) cannot be launched properly. To verify this, try to launch the
'gdb' command from a shell (i.e outside GPS). If gdb cannot be launched from
a shell, it usually means that you are using a wrong version of gdb
(e.g a version of gdb built for Solaris 8, but run on Solaris 2.6).

@item GPS is frozen during a debugging session
@cindex debugger
If GPS is no longer responding while debugging an application you should
first wait a little bit, since some communications between GPS and gdb
can take a long time to finish. If GPS is still not responding after a
few minutes, you can usually get the control back in GPS by either typing
@key{Ctrl-C} in the shell where you've started GPS: this should unblock it;
if it does not work, you can kill the gdb process launched by GPS using the
@code{ps} and @code{kill}, or the @code{top} command under Unix,
@cindex Unix
@cindex Windows
and the @code{Task Manager} under Windows: this will terminate your debugging
session, and will unblock GPS.

@item My Ada program fails during elaboration. How can I debug it ?
@cindex -g
@cindex gnatmake
If your program was compiled with GNAT, the main program is
generated by the binder. This program is an ordinary Ada (or C if the
@option{-C} switch was used) program, compiled in the usual manner,
and fully debuggable provided that the @option{-g} switch is used on
the @command{gnatlink} command (or @option{-g} is used in the
@command{gnatmake} command itself).

The name of this package containing the main program is
@file{b~xxx.ads/adb} where xxx is the name of the Ada main unit given
in the gnatbind command, and you can edit and debug this file in the
normal manner. You will see a series of calls to the elaboration
routines of the packages, and you can debug these in the usual manner,
just as if you were debugging code in your application.

@item How can I debug the Ada run-time library ?
The run time distributed in binary versions of GNAT hasn't been
compiled with debug information. Thus, it needs to be recompiled
before you can actually debug it.

The simplest is to recompile your application by adding the switches
@option{-a} and @option{-f} to the @command{gnatmake} command
line. This extra step is then no longer required, assuming that you
keep the generated object and ali files corresponding to the GNAT run time
available.

Another possibility on Unix systems is to use the file @file{Makefile.adalib}
that can be found in the adalib directory of your GNAT installation and
specify e.g @option{-g -O2} for the @option{CFLAGS} switches.

@item The GPS main window is not displayed
If when launching GPS, nothing happens, you can try to rename the @file{.gps}
directory (see @ref{Files}) to start from a fresh set up.

@item My project have several files with the same name. How can I import it in GPS?
GPS's projects do not allow implicit overriding of sources file, i.e.
you cannot have multiple times the same file name in the project
hierarchy. The reason is that GPS needs to know exactly where the file
is, and cannot reliably guess which occurrence to use.

There are several solutions to handle this issue:

@itemize @bullet
@item Use scenario variables in the project
The idea is that you define various scenarios in your project (For
instance compiling in "debug" mode or "production" mode), and change
the source directories depending on this setup.  Such projects can be
edited directly from GPS (in the project properties editor, this is
the right part of the window, as described in this documentation). On
top of the project explorer (left part of the GPS main window), you
have a combo box displayed for each of the variable, allowing a simple
switch between scenarios depending on what you want to build.

@item Use extending projects
These projects cannot currently be created through GPS, so you will
need to edit them by hand. See the GNAT user's guide for more
information on extending projects.

The idea behind this approach is that you can have a local overriding of some
source files from the common build/source setup (if you are working
on a small part of the whole system, you may not want to have a complete
copy of the code on your local machine).
