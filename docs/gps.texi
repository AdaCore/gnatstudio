@chapter Introduction
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
GPS is a complete integrated development environment that gives access
to a wide range of tools and integrates them smoothly.

This version is considered as beta software, meaning that you may encounter
some instabilities or some missing features. For this reason we will
particularly welcome bug reports, as well as suggestions for possible
improvements (see @ref{Reporting Suggestions and Bugs}).

GPS gives access to built-in file editing; HTML based help system;
complete compile/build/run cycle; intelligent source navigation;
project management; general graph technology giving access to many different
browsers such as source dependency, project dependency, call graphs, etc@dots{};
fully integrated visual debugger, based on the GVD technology, and enhanced
for inclusion in GPS; generic version control system, providing access
to CVS, ClearCase, and possibly others in the future; many other tools
such as a visual comparison, automatic generation of files, source reformatting.

GPS is fully customizable, providing several levels of customizations:
a first level, available through the preferences dialog (see
@ref{Customization}); a second level, which allows you to
customize your menu items, tool bar and key bindings (see @ref{Customization}),
and a third level, which allows any kind of very specific or tight
integration, due to the open nature of GPS, and to its architecture.

GPS also integrates with existing editors such as Emacs and Vi, see
@ref{Using an External Editor}.

@node The Welcome Dialog
@section The Welcome Dialog
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@noindent

When starting GPS, a welcome dialog is displayed by default, giving the
following choices:

@table @b
@item Start with default project
If you select this option and click on the @code{OK} button, GPS will create a
default internal project with the following properties:

  The project supports Ada files only, using the default GNAT
  naming scheme: @code{.ads} for spec files, @code{.adb} for body files.

  A single source directory corresponding to the current directory.
  The current directory can be set by modifying the text entry on clicking
  on the @code{Browse} button. All the Ada files found in this directory
  will be considered as part of the default project.

  The object directory where the object and executable files will
  be put, corresponding also to the current directory.

@item Create new project with wizard
Selecting this option and clicking on the @code{OK} button will start a
wizard allowing you to specify most of the properties for a new project. Once
the project is created, GPS will save it and load it automatically.
@c See ??? for more details on the project wizard.

@item Open existing project
You can select an existing project by clicking on the @code{Browse} button,
or by using a previousely loaded project listed in the combo box. When a
project is selected, clicking on the @code{OK} button will load this
project and open the main window.

@item Always show this dialog when GPS starts
If unset, the welcome dialog won't be shown in future sessions.
In this case, GPS will behave as follows: it will first look for a
@code{-P} switch on the command line, and load the coresponding project if
present.
Then, it will look for a project file in the current directory and will
load the first project file found.

If no project file can be found in the current directory, GPS will start
with the default project.

To reset this properties, you can go to the menu @code{Edit->Preferences}.
@c See ???.

@item Quit
If you click on this button, GPS will terminate immediately.
@end table

When you specify a -P switch on the command line, or if there is only one
project file in the current directory, GPS will start immediately with
the project file specified, instead of displaying the welcome dialog.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node The Menu Bar
@section The Menu Bar
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@noindent

This is a standard menu bar that gives access to all the global
functionalities of GPS. It is usually easier to access a given functionality
using the various contextual menus provided throughout GPS: these menus
give direct access to the most relevant actions given the current context
(e.g. a project, a directory, a file, an entity, @dots{}). Contextual menus
pop up when the right mouse button is clicked.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node The Tool Bar
@section The Tool Bar
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@noindent

The toolbar provides shortcuts via buttons to some typical actions:
creating a new file, opening a file, saving the current file;
undo/redo last editing;
cut to clipboard, copy to clipboard, paste from clipboard;
go to previous/next location;
start/continue the debugging session, step/next execution, finish
current procedure.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node The Work Space
@section The Work Space
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

The whole work space is based on a multiple document interface,
@xref{Multiple Document Interface}.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node The Project Explorer
@section The Project Explorer
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@noindent

The project explorer is composed of multiple views which can be accessed
by default by clicking on the corresponding pages, or if they are not shown
by using the @code{Project} menu items.

@subsection The explorer views

The explorer views are
initially displayed on the left side of the GPS window. Their goal is to
show a full view of the various components of your projects. These
various components are presented below.

The following snapshot displays the two pages side-by-side: on the
left, the @code{Project View}, and on the right the @code{File View}.

@iftex
@image{explorer-views, 12.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@image{explorer-views, 12.7cm}
@end ifhtml

The various components that are displayed in these explorers are the
following:

@table @b
@item projects
As mentioned before, all the sources you are working with are put under
control of projects. These projects are a way to store the switches to
use for the various tools, as well as a number of other properties.

They can be organized into a project hierarchy, where a root project
can import other projects, with their own set of sources.

Initially, a default project is created, that includes all the sources
in the current directory.

The @code{Project View} page of the explorer displays this project
hierarchy: the top node in this view is the root project of your
application (generally, this is where the source file that contains
the main subprogram will be located). Then a node is displayed for
each imported project, and recursively for their own imported
projects.

A given project might appear multiple times in the @code{Project
View}, if it is imported by several other projects.

A special icon with an exclamation mark is displayed if the project
was modified, but not saved yet. You can choose to save it at any time
by right-clicking on it. GPS will remind you to save it before any
compilation.

@item directories
The files inside a project can be organized into several physical
directories on the disk. These directories are displayed under each
project node in the @code{Project View}, or directly mimicking their
physical organization on the disk (including windows drives) in the
@code{File View}.

@item files
The source files themselves are stored in the directories, and
displayed under the corresponding nodes. Note that in the
@code{Project View}, only the source files that actually belong to the
project (i.e. are written in a language supported by that project and
follow its naming scheme) are actually visible.

The @code{File View} will display all the files that actually exist
on the disk.

A given file might appear multiple times in the @code{Project View},
if the project it belongs to is imported by several other projects.

@item entities
If you open the node for a source file, the file is parsed by one of the
fast parsers integrated in GPS so that all entities declared in
the project can be shown. These entities are grouped into various
categories, which depend on the language. Typical categories include
subprograms, packages, types, variables, tasks,@dots{}

@end table

Double-clicking on an file, or simple clicking on any entity will open
a source editor and display respectively the first line in this file
or the line on which the entity is defined.

If you open the search dialog through the @code{Navigate->Find...}
menu, you have the possibility to search for anything in the explorer,
either a file or an entity. Note that searching for an entity might be
a little slow if you have lots of files.

A contextual menu, named @code{Locate in Explorer}, is also provided when
inside a source editor. This will automatically search for the first entry for
this file in the explorer. This contextual menu is also available in other
modules, e.g. when selecting a file in the @code{Dependency Browser}.


@subsection The configuration variables

As described in the GNAT User's Guide, the project files can be
configured through external variables (typically environment
variables). This means that e.g. the exact list of source files, or the
exact switches to use to compile the application can be changed when
the value of these external variables is changed.

GPS provides a simple access to these variables, through a special
area on top of the @code{Project View}. These variables are called
@code{Configuration Variables}, since they provide various scenarios for
the same set of project files.

A combo box is displayed in this area for each environment
variable the project depends on. The current value of the variable can
be set simply by selecting it from the popdown window that appears
when you click on the arrow on the right of the variable name

New variables can be added through the contextual menu @code{Add
Configuration Variable} in the @code{Project View}. The list of
possible values for a variable can be changed by clicking on the
button on the left of the variable's name.

Whenever you change the value of one of the variables, the project is
automatically recomputed, and the list of source files or directories
is changed dynamically to reflect the new status of the
project. Starting a new compilation at that point will use the new
switches, and all the aspects of GPS are immediately affected
according to the new setup.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node The Messages Window
@section The Messages Window
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@noindent

The Messages window is used by GPS to display information and feedback
about operations, such as build output, information about processes
launched, error messages.

This is a read-only window, which means that only output is available,
no input is possible.

For an input/output window, see @ref{The Execution Window} and also
@ref{The Shell Window}.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node The Shell Window
@section The Shell Window
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@noindent

This window gives access to a shell specific to GPS, that allows you to
type commands such as editing a file, compiling without using the menu
items or the mouse.

The Shell Window is a work in progress so only a few commands are currently
available. To get the full list of currently available commands, simply
type @code{help} at the prompt, or @code{help} followed by the name of a
command, to get more information about a specific command.

You can use the @key{up} and @key{down} arrows to navigate through the
history of commands.

The intent is to provide all the commands available in GPS via the GPS
shell, as well as providing access to the shell capabilities in batch
mode, in order to help automate processes such as builds, automatic
generation of graphs, @dots{}

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node The Locations Tree
@section The Locations Tree
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@noindent

The Location Tree is filled whenever GPS needs to display a list of
locations in the source files (typically, when performing a global
search, compilation results, and so on).

@iftex
@image{locations-view, 12.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@image{locations-view, 12.7cm}
@end ifhtml

The Location Tree shows a hierarchy of categories, which contain
files, which contain locations. Clicking on a location item will bring
up a file editor at the requested place. Right-clicking on file or
category items brings up a contextual menu allowing you to remove the
corresponding node from the view.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node The Execution Window
@section The Execution Window
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@noindent

Each time a program is launched using the menu @code{Build->Run}, a new
execution window is created to provide input and output for this program.

In order to allow post mortem analysis and copy/pasting, the execution
windows are not destroyed when the application terminates.

To close an execution window, click on the arrow icon on the top right corner
of the window, or use the menu @code{File->Close}, or the menu @code{Window->Close}
or the key binding @key{Ctrl-W}.

If you close the execution window while the application is still running,
a dialog window is displayed, asking whether you want to kill the application,
or to cancel the close operation.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node The Status Line
@section The Status Line
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@noindent

The status line is composed of two areas: on the left a status bar and
on the right a progress bar.

The status bar is used to display temporary information about GPS
operations. Note that most of the information GPS displays can be found
in the @code{Messages} window.

The progress bar is used to display information about on going operations
such as builds.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Integrated Help
@chapter Integrated Help
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

By default when you start GPS, the working area contains a help window
displaying HTML help files. On-line help for the GNAT tools is available
from the @code{Help} menu item.

GPS will look in the @code{<prefix>/doc/gps/html} directory for the default
help menus, and if the corresponding documentation cannot be found, the
@code{Help} menu items will be disabled.

Since HTML pages can contain lots of complex information, resizing the
help window can take some time, making the user interface less responsive.
It is therefore recommended to close the @code{Help} window
when not using it. You can reopen this window at any time using the
@code{Help} menu item.

For the best use of the integrated help, it is recommended to load small
HTML pages each time instead of long pages which will be slow to load and
display.

@noindent

All the windows that are part of the GPS environment are under control
of what is commonly called a multiple document interface (MDI for
short). This is a common paradigm on windowing systems, where related
windows are put into a bigger window which is itself under control of
the system or the windows manager.

This means that, by default, no matter how many editors, browsers,
explorers,@dots{} windows you have opened, your system will still see only
one window (On Windows systems, the task bar shows only one
icon). However, you can organize the GPS windows exactly the way you
want, all inside the GPS main window.

For instance, you can choose to iconify some windows which are
temporarily useless to you; you can choose to put some windows on top
of others; you can resize all the windows to the size you want; and so
on.

This section will show the various capacities that GPS provides to
help you organize your workspace.

At any time, there is only one selected window in GPS (the @b{active
window}). You can select a window either by clicking in its title bar,
which will then get a different color, or by selecting its name in the
menu @code{Window}.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Closing Windows
@section Closing Windows
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent

Wherever the windows are displayed, they are always closed in the same
manner. In the right side of the title bar of the window, three small
buttons are displayed. The rightmost button is a cross. Clicking on
this button will close the window

@iftex
@image{mdi-title-bar, 12.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@image{mdi-title-bar, 12.7cm}
@end ifhtml

Alternatively, you can also select the window by clicking anywhere in
its title bar, and then select the menu @code{Window->Close}

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Maximized and Iconified Windows
@section Maximized and Iconified Windows
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent

The MDI is initially split into three parts: one window to the left,
one to the bottom, and a bigger one that occupies the remaining space.

The first two will be discussed in @ref{Docked Windows}.
The third area is the one that provides the most flexibility:

@table @b

@item maximized windows
The windows in this area are initially maximized. This means that if
you have several windows, a notebook will be created, and only one
window will be visible at any given time. You select the window you want
to see by clicking on the appropriate tab.

Note that if there are a lot of windows, two small arrows will appear
on the right of the tabs. Clicking on these arrows will show the
remaining tabs.

@iftex
@image{mdi-scroll-tabs, 12.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@image{mdi-scroll-tabs, 12.7cm}
@end ifhtml

You can go back to this maximized state in two ways: either select the
menu @code{Window->Maximize All}, or click on the middle button on the
right of the title bar of any window (this button shows two small
squares, and will toggle between maximized and unmaximized states.


@item unmaximized windows
As opposed to putting all the windows inside a notebook, GPS can also
let you organize them freely when they are unmaximized. Select the
menu @code{Window->Unmaximize All}, or click again in the middle
button on the right of the title bar.

In this mode, the windows can be resized freely by clicking on the
border of any side or in one of their four corners, as usual on
windowing systems.

They can also be moved around. As a result, you can choose for
instance to display several windows side by side, or one on top of
the others.

To make it easier to get to these standard organizations, GPS provides
a few shortcuts through menus:

@table @code
@item Window->Cascade
All the windows will be resized to the same size, and be moved one on
top of the other, so that the top and left sides of all windows are
visible. This way, you can easily select any window

@ifhtml
@image{mdi-cascade, 12.7cm}
@end ifhtml

@item Window->Tile Horizontally
All the windows are resized to the same dimensions, and are put side
by side, from left to right. No window will overlap any other.

@iftex
@image{mdi-tile-horizontal, 12.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@image{mdi-tile-horizontal, 12.7cm}
@end ifhtml

@item Window->Tile Vertically
All the windows are resized to the same dimensions, and are put side
by side, from top to bottom. No window will overlap any other.

@iftex
@image{mdi-tile-vertical, 12.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@image{mdi-tile-vertical, 12.7cm}
@end ifhtml

@end table


@item iconified windows
When the windows are unmaximized, you can also choose to temporarily
iconify some of them. This is done by clicking on the leftmost button
in the title bar (the one that shows a single line).

The window will then be resized so that only part of its title bar is
visible, and none of its actual contents. Icons can still be moved
around as you want, but they can not be resized. You need to first
de-iconify the window, by clicking once again on the same button.

When de-iconified, a window will restore the size and position it had
before it was iconified.

@iftex
@image{mdi-icons, 12.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@image{mdi-icons, 12.7cm}
@end ifhtml

@end table

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Docked Windows
@section Docked Windows
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent

As mentioned before, the GPS workspace is initially split into three
windows. The one on the left and the one at the bottom are called
@b{docking area}.

They have a different behavior from the central area, since windows in
these areas are necessarily grouped into a notebook. Thus, only one of
them is visible at any given time, and you select the one you want to
see by clicking on its name in the tabs area.

GPS includes four such areas, one on each side of the main area. Some
widgets will initially be displayed in one of these docking areas
instead of in the central one, like the project explorer, the message
window,@dots{} Although you can not control this initial position, it is
possible to change it later on (@ref{Moving Windows}).

However, you can still choose precisely the dimension you want for
this docking area (either its width for the left and right areas, or
its height for the top and bottom ones).

Between each docking area and the central one, there is a small handle
(on which a series of dots are drawn), that you can move interactively
with the mouse, to resize the docking areas). By default, when you
move such a handle, a line will appear on top of all other windows in
GPS to show you the new position the docking area will have when you
release the mouse. You can set up a preference (menu
@code{Edit->Preferences}) to indicate that you want the resizing to be
opaque, which might give more intuitive results.

Note that when a window is @b{docked} (i.e. put in a docking area), some
of the buttons in its title bar are greyed out and inactive.

A simple way to dock a window is to select it, and then select the
menu @code{Window->Docked}. We will see in @ref{Moving Windows} that
there is a more intuitive way to do the same thing.

In some cases, GPS will change the color used to draw the title of the
window in the notebook tab. This indicates that the window content
has been updated, but the window wasn't visible. Typically,
this is used to indicate that new messages have been written in the
messages or console window.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Floating Windows
@section Floating Windows
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent

Although the MDI, as described so far, is already extremely flexible,
it is possible that you prefer to have several top-level windows under
direct control of your system or window manager. This would be the
case for instance if you want to benefit from some extra possibilities
that your system might provide (virtual desktops, different window
decoration depending on the window's type, transparent windows,@dots{}).

GPS is fully compatible with this behavior, since windows can also be
@b{floating windows}. Any window that is currenty embedded in the MDI
can be made floating at any time, simply by selecting the window and
then selecting the menu @code{Window->Floating}. The window will then
be detached, and can be moved anywhere on your screen, even outside of
GPS's main window.

There are two ways to put a floating window back under control of GPS.
The more general method is to select the window through its title in
the menu @code{Window}, and then select @code{Window->Floating}.

The second method assumes that the preference @b{Destroy Floats} in
the menu @code{Edit->Preferences} has been set to false. Then, you can
simply close the floating window by clicking in the appropriate title
bar button, and the window will be put back in GPS. If you actually
want to close it, you need to click once again on the cross button in
its title bar.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Moving Windows
@section Moving Windows
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent

As we have seen, the windows' state can be changed at any time, from
maximized to unmaximized to docked and floating and back, in any
order.

In all cases, the changes are done either through the buttons in the
title bar or through the menu @code{Window}.

On some systems, a more intuitive method is also provided, based on
the drag-and-drop paradigm. The idea is simply to select a window,
wherever it is, and then, by clicking on it and moving the mouse while
keeping the left button pressed, drop it anywhere else inside GPS.

Selecting an item so that it can be dragged is done simply by clicking
with the left mouse button in its title bar, and keep the button
pressed while moving the mouse. Although this is the general scheme,
this would work for unmaximized items, since the title bar is then
used to move them around. In that case, you need to press the
@key{control} key in addition to the left mouse button.

A third possibily can be used for maximized or docked windows: click
with the left mouse button in the notebook tab that contains their
name.

It is important to note that some widgets in GPS have their own
drag-and-drop support, and will not react when you drop a window on
them. For instance, editors use drag-and-drop for copy-paste
operations. Therefore, dropping a window on them will result in a
failed operation. In that case, it always works to drop the window in
the title bar of another window to adopt the same state.


Here are the various places where a window can be dropped:

@table @b
@item The central area
The window you are dropping will get the same state as the other
windows already in this area (maximized or unmaximized).

@item Docking areas
The window will immediately be adopted by this dropping area, and a
new notebook will be created as needed. Once again, since the message
window has its own handling of drag-and-drop, you can not drop items
on it. Instead, drop windows on its title bar.

In some cases, you might want to create a docking area that is not
currently visible (for instance, it is often useful to put an editor
in the right docking area, so that two editors can be seen
side-by-side, one in this area, and one in the central one).

To achieve this, drop the window on the small handle that surrounds
the whole GPS window (a black rectangle will appear on the screen when
your mouse is over that area). If you then drop the item, a new
docking area will be created.

@item System window
Under systems that support it, if you drop a window outside of GPS (for
instance, on the background of your screen), the window will be floated.

@item Sides of the GPS window
On each side of the GPS window, a small zone (a few pixels high or
wide) is set up as a drop-area. If you drop a window on these zone
(they are briefly highlighted while the mouse rests on them), then the
window will be added to the dock on that side. If there is no dock
area on that side, one will be created.

This is especially useful if you want to put two editor windows side
by side. Drag one of them on the drop area on the right side.

@section Using an External Editor
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent

GPS is fully integrated with a number of external editors, in
particular @file{Emacs} and @file{vi}. The choice of the default
external editor is done in the preferences. The following values are
recognized:

@table @file
@item gnuclient
This is the recommended client. It is based on Emacs, but needs an
extra package to be installed. This is the only client that provides a
full integration in GPS, since any extended lisp command can be sent
to the Emacs server.

By default, gnuclient will open a new Emacs frame for every file
that is opened. You might want to add the following code to your
@file{.emacs} file (create one if needed) so that the same Emacs frame
is reused every time:

@smallexample
   (setq gnuserv-frame (car (frame-list)))
@end smallexample

See @url{http://www.hpl.hp.co.uk/people/ange/gnuserv/} for more information.


@item emacsclient
This is a program that is always available if you have installed
Emacs. As opposed to starting a new Emacs every time, it will reuse an
existing Emacs session. It is then extremely fast to open a file.


@item emacs
This client will start a new Emacs session every time a file needs to
be opened. You should use @file{emacsclient} instead, since it is much
faster, and makes it easier to copy and paste between multiple
files. Basically, the only reason to use this external editor is if
your system doesn't support @file{emacsclient}.


@item vim
@file{Vim} is a vi-like editor that provides a number of enhancements,
for instance syntax highlighting for all the languages supported by
GPS. Selecting this external editor will start an xterm (or command
window, depending on your system) with a running vim process editing
the file.

Note that one limitation of this editor is that if GPS needs to open
the same file a second time, it will open a new editor, instead of
reusing the existing one.

To enable this capability, the xterm executable must found in the PATH,
and thus is not currently supported on Windows systems.


@item vi
This editor works exactly like vim, but uses the standard @file{vi}
command instead of @file{vim}.


@item none
No external editor is used, and the contextual menus simply won't
appear.
@end table


In the cases that require an Emacs server, GPS will try several
solutions if no already running server was found. It will first try to
spawn the glide environment distributed with GNAT. If not found in the
PATH, it will then start a standard Emacs. The project file currently used
in GPS will be set appropriately the first time Emacs is spawned. This means
that if you load a new project in GPS, or modify the paths of the current
project, you should kill any running Emacs, so that a new one is spawned
by GPS with the appropriate project.

Of course, you can alternatively reload explicitly the project from
Emacs itself by using the menu @code{Project->Load}


In the preferences, there are two settings that allow you to select
the external editor (if left to an empty string, GPS will
automatically select the first editor available on your system) and
whether this editor should always be used every time you double-click
on a file, or whether you need to explicitly select the contextual
menu to open the external editor.

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Using the Clipboard
@section Using the Clipboard
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section concerns X-Window users who are used to cutting and
pasting with the middle mouse button. In the GPS text editor, as in
many recent X applications, the @i{GPS clipboard} is set by explicit
cut/copy/paste actions, either through menu items or keyboard
shorcuts, and the @i{primary clipboard} (i.e. the ``middle button''
clipboard) is set by the current selection.

Therefore, copy/paste between GPS and other X applications using the
@i{primary clipboard} will still work, provided that there is some
text currently selected. The @i{GPS clipboard}, when set, will
override the @i{primary clipboard}.

See @url{http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/clipboards.txt} for more
information.

@end menu

@node Support for Cross References
@section Support for Cross References
@noindent

GPS provides cross-references for most of the entities defined in your
application, as well as some advanced browsers like a call graph.
For this to work, it needs some help from external tools, specific to
each of the supported languages.

@table @command
@item Ada
The GNAT compiler itself is used to generate the cross-references
information. This means that you need to compile your application to
get access to this feature or the various graphs. GPS doesn't provide
automatic recompilation at the moment, although this is a planned
feature. If your sources have been modified, you should recompile the
modified files.

If you need to navigate through sources that are not fully compilable
(e.g after heavy modifications, or while porting an application), GNAT
can still generate partial information if you specify the @code{-gnatQ}
compilation option. Along with the @code{-k} option of gnatmake, it is
then possible to generate as much relevant information as possible for a
complete set of non compilable sources.

There are a few special cases where GPS can not find the external file
(called @file{ALI file}) that contains the cross-reference
information. Most likely, this is either because you haven't compiled
your sources yet, or because the source code has changed since the
@file{ALI file} was generated.

It could also be that you haven't included in the project the object
directories that contain the @file{ALI files}.

In addition, one special case can not be handled automatically. This
is for separate units, whose file names have been krunched through the
@file{gnatkr} command. To handle this, you should force GPS to parse
all the @file{ALI files} in the appropriate object directory. This is
done by right-clicking on the object directory in the explorer
(left-side panel on the main window), and selecting the menu "Parse
all xref information".

@item C/C++
To enable the navigation features for C and C++ source files, you need
to first generate a database of symbol references, by going through the
menu Build->Recompute C/C++ Xref info. Messages in the console window
will indicate the state of the processing. Due to the nature of these
languages, in order to provide accurate cross references, GPS needs to
generate the database in two phases: a first pass parses all the files
that have been modified since the previous parsing, and a second pass
generates global cross references by analysing the complete database.
It is thus expected that for large projects, this phase can take a
significant amount of cpu to proceed.

In some cases, GPS won't be able to determine the exact function involved
in a cross reference. This will typically occur for overloaded functions,
or if multiple functions with the same name, but under different
@code{#ifdef} sections, are defined. In this case, GPS will display a
dialog listing the possible choices to resolve the ambiguity.

In addition, the C/C++ parser has the following limitations: namespaces
are currently ignored (no specific processing is done for namespaces);
no attempt is made to process the macros and other preprocessor defines.
Macros are considered as special entities, so it is possible to navigate
from a macro use to its definition, but the macro content is ignored,
which means for example that function calls made through macros
won't be detected.

@node Project Handling
@chapter Project Handling
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
To handle projects, GPS uses the GNAT project file facility, as described
in the GNAT User's Guide (@url{gnat_ug.html}) and in the GNAT Reference
Manual (@url{gnat_rm.html}). For a best use of the project capabilities, it
is recommended to first become familiar with this documentation.

The project files are text files following a syntax close to Ada, it is thus
possible to edit and modify them by hand, as well as generating them and
loading them within GPS, both manual and automatic generation can be
mixed. For example, you can first generate projects automatically using
the @i{Project Wizard}, and then modify them by hand.

All the non graphical GNAT tools are project aware, meaning that the notion
of project goes well beyond GPS' user interface, and most capabilities of
the project file can be accessed without using GPS itself, making the
project files very attractive.


@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Searching and Replacing
@chapter Searching and Replacing
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

GPS provides extensive search capabilities among its different
elements. For instance, it is possible to search in the currently
edited source file, or in all the source files belonging to the
project, even those that are not currently open. It is also possible
to search in the project explorer (on the left side of the main GPS
window), or the help modules,@dots{}

All these search contexts are grouped into a single graphical window,
that you can open either through the menu @code{Navigate->Find}, or
the shortcut @key{Control-F}.

Selecting either of these two options will pop up a dialog on the
screen, similar to the following:

@iftex
@image{search-hide, 12.7cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@image{search-hide, 12.7cm}
@end ifhtml

On this screenshot, you can see three entry fields:

@table @b
@item @code{"Search for"}
This is the location where you type the string or pattern you are
looking for. The search widget supports two modes, either fixed strings
or regular expressions. You can commute between the two modes by
either clicking on the @code{Options} button and selecting the
appropriate check box, or by opening the combo box (click on the arrow
on the right of the entry field).

In this combo box, a number of predefined patterns are provided. The
top two ones are empty patterns, that automatically set up the
appropriate fixed strings/regular expression mode. The other regular
expressions are language-specific, and will match patterns like Ada
type definition, C++ method declaration,@dots{}

@item @code{"Replace with"}
This field should contain the string that will replace the occurrences
of the pattern defined above.
The combo box provides a history of previously used replacement
strings.

@item @code{"Look in"}
This field defines the context in which the search should
occur. Clicking on the arrow on the right will display the list of all
possible contexts. The exact list will depend on what modules were
loaded by GPS, since each module can add its own contexts.

Depending on the selected context, extra fields might be displayed on
the screen. For instance, if you select the context @code{Files...}
you will be asked what files or directories should be searched. These
are regular expressions.

When searching one or more source files, an extra field to select the
scope is provided. This is used to avoid matching on comments when you
are only interested in actual code, or to only search strings and
comments, and ignore the code.

GPS will automatically select the most appropriate context when you
open the search dialog, depending on which component currently has the
focus. However, you can of course change the context to the one you
prefer.

@end table

The second part of the window is a row of buttons, to start the search
(or continue to the next occurrence), to stop the current search when
it is taking too long, or to display the options.

@iftex
@image{search-options, 12.0cm}
@end iftex

@ifhtml
@image{search-options, 12.7cm}
@end ifhtml

There are four check boxes in this options box.

@table @b
@item @code{"Search All Occurrences"}
The default mode for the search widget is interactive searching: its
stops as soon as one occurence of the pattern is found. You then have
to press the @code{Next} button (or the equivalent shortcut
@key{Control-N}) to go to the next occurrence.

However, if you enable this check box, the search widget will start
searching for all occurrences right away, and put the results in a new
window called @code{Locations} (initially found in the bottom dock of
the GPS window). You can interrupt the search at any time by pressing
the @code{Stop} button: this will stop when the next occurrence is found.

@item @code{"Case Sensitive"}
By default, patterns are case insensitive (upper-case letters and
lower-case letters are considered as equivalent). You can change this
behavior by clicking on this check box.

@item @code{"Whole Word Only"}
If activated, this check box will force the search engine to ignore
substrings. "sensitive" will no longer match "insensitive".

@item @code{"Regular Expression"}
This button commutes between fixed string patterns and regular
expressions. As mentioned above, you can also commute between these two modes
by selecting the arrow on the right of the @code{Search for:} field.

@end table

As most GPS components, the search window is under control of the
multiple document interface, and can thus be integrated into the main
GPS window instead of being an external window.

To force this behavior, open the menu @code{Window}, select
@code{Search} in the list at the bottom of the menu, and then select
either @code{Floating} or @code{Docked}.

If you save the desktop (@code{File->Save...->Desktop}, GPS will
automatically reopen the search dialog in its new place when it is
started next time.

@section Integrating existing build procedures with the GPS build system
@noindent

Since the build system provided by GPS is based on makefiles, it is possible
to integrate existing build scripts and makefiles. In the following section,
we will call such projects that integrate with existing build procedures a
@i{foreign project}.

You first need to provide your own @code{Makefile.<project>} file, that will
provide stubs to the real build commands.

Then to tell GPS that it should not generate automatically the makefile
corresponding to a given project, set the read-only attribute on the
makefile, e.g under unix:

@smallexample
$ chmod -w Makefile.<project>
@end smallexample

or under Windows:

@smallexample
> attrib +r Makefile.<project>
@end smallexample

This way when saving the project, GPS knows that the existing makefile
should not be overriden.

Depending on your project, you will need to define some or all of the
following targets in the makefile stub:

@table @b
@item internal-build
This is the main rule, used for building all the files for a foreign
project.

@item internal-clean
This is an optional rule, used to clean the temporary files, e.g. the
object files generated during the build.

@item SRC_DIRS

@item LDFLAGS

@item LIBS

@item DEPS_PROJECTS

@end table

For example, suppose we have a foreign project called @code{Foo},
with an existing makefile, here is how Makefile.foo would look like:

@smallexample
ifeq ($(FOO_PROJECT),)
FOO_PROJECT=True

ifeq ($(BASE_DIR),)
   BASE_DIR=$(shell pwd)
   FOO_ROOT=True

# Redirect clean to the real clean rule
   internal-clean:
        $(MAKE) clean

# Ditto for the build rule
   internal-build:
        $(MAKE) build
endif

FOO_BASE_DIR := $(BASE_DIR)

# Add our source directories to the default search path
# so that other projects can reference our include files
FOO_SRC_DIRS = $(FOO_BASE_DIR)/include $(FOO_BASE_DIR)/include2
SRC_DIRS += $(FOO_SRC_DIRS)

# Add <build>/libfoo.a, built by the internal-build rule above, to the
# list of libraries to link with
LIBS := $(FOO_BASE_DIR)/<build>/libfoo.a $(LIBS)

ifneq ($(FOO_ROOT),True)
   DEPS_PROJECTS += $(FOO_BASE_DIR)/foo
endif

@chapter Debugging
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------

@noindent
Debugging is tightly integrated with the other components of GPS. For
example, it is possible to edit files and navigate through your sources
while debugging.

To start a debug session, go to the menu @code{Debug->Initialize}, and choose
either the name of your executable, if you have specified the name of
your main program(s) in the project properties, or start an empty debug
session using the @code{<no main file>} item. It is then possible to load
any file to debug, by using the menu @code{Debug->Debug->Load File...}

After the debugger has been initialized, you have access to two new windows:
the data window (in the top of the working area), and the debugger console
(in a new page, after the Messages and Shell windows).
All the menus under @code{Debugger}
are now also accessible, and you also have access to additional contextual
menus, in particular in the source editor where it is possible to easily
display variables, set breakpoints, and get automatic display (via @i{tooltips})
of object values.

When you want to quit the debugger without quitting GPS, go to the menu
@code{Debug->Terminate}, which will terminate your debug session.

@node Customizing the Menu Bar
@section Customizing the Menu Bar
@noindent

The GPS menu bar can be customized through an XML file called
@file{custom} in the gps home directory (@file{~/.gps} on Unix
systems).

Here is an example for such a file:

@smallexample
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<Custom>

  <Submenu>
    <Title>custom menu</Title>

    <Menu_Item>
    <Title>item 1</Title>
      <Action>shell command 1</Action>
    </Menu_Item>

    <Submenu>
      <Title>other menu</Title>
      <Menu_Item>
        <Title> (etc..)
      </Menu_Item>

      <Submenu>
        (...)
      </Submenu>
    </Submenu>
  </Submenu>

  <Submenu>
    <Title>custom menu number 2</Title>
    (...)
  </Submenu>

</Custom>
@end smallexample

The example above creates two toplevel menus, named @file{custom menu}
and @file{custom menu number 2}. The first one contains a menu item named
@file{item 1}, which is associated to the shell command @file{shell command
1}, and a submenu named @file{other menu}, and so on.

As well as shell commands, you can use custom menu items to invoke GPS
shell commands. The following example shows how to create menus to
invoke the @file{help} interactive command and to open the file
@file{main.c}.

@smallexample
<Submenu>
   <Title>Edit</Title>
     <Menu_Item>
           <Title>List GPS commands</Title>
           <GPS_Action>help</GPS_Action>
     </Menu_Item>
     <Menu_Item>
           <Title>Edit main.c</Title>
           <GPS_Action>edit main.c</GPS_Action>
     </Menu_Item>
</Submenu>
@end smallexample

You can define the accelerator keys for your menus, using underscores
in the titles. Thus, if you want an accelerator on the first letter in
a menu named @file{File}, set its title as @file{_File}.

You can add items or submenus to existing menus, using titles for
menus that already exist. For example, this adds an item named
@file{Robert} to the @file{Edit} menu.

@smallexample
<Submenu>
  <Title>Edit</Title>
  <Menu_Item>
    <Title>Robert</Title>
  </Menu_Item>
</Submenu>
@end smallexample

Use the @file{/} separator to identify the submenu in a menu. For
example, this adds a submenu named @file{Olga} containing an item named
@file{Item} to the @file{Edit} menu.

@smallexample
<Submenu>
  <Title>Edit/Olga</Title>
  <Menu_Item>
    <Title>Item</Title>
  </Menu_Item>
</Submenu>
@end smallexample

Adding an item with an empty title or no title at all inserts a
menu separator.

As an alternative to creating new menu items, you can create new
buttons on the toolbar, with exactly the same syntax, by using
the @file{<Toolbar_Item>} tag in place of the @file{<Menu_Item>} tag.
Within this tag, the tag @file{<Pixmap>} can be used to indicate
the location of an image file (of the type @file{jpeg}, @file{png}, @file{gif}
or @file{xpm}) to be used as icon for the button. An empty @file{<Toolbar_Item>}
tag indicates a separator in the toolbar.

@smallexample
<Submenu>
   <Title>Toolbar Items</Title>

   <Toolbar_Item></Toolbar_Item>

   <Toolbar_Item>
     <Title>Custom Button</Title>
     <Pixmap>/my_pixmaps/button.jpg</Pixmap>
     <GPS_Action>my gps command</GPS_Action>
   </Toolbar_Item>
</Submenu>
@end smallexample

You can use macro arguments to pass to your shell
commands. Macro arguments are special parameters that are transformed
every time that the command is about to be executed. The following
macro arguments exist in GPS:

@table @file
@item %f
Base name of the currently opened file.

@item %F
Absolute name of the currently opened file.

@item %p
The current project.

@item %P
The root project.

@item %(p|P)[r](d|s)[f]
Substituted by the contents of a project :

P : the project is the root project

p : the project is the current project

r : indicates that the listing should be project-recursive, i.e. that
sub-projects should be listed as well, and their subprojects, and so
on.

d : list the source directories

s : list the source files

f : output the list into a file and substitute the parameter with the
name of that file.
@end table

Examples :

@table @file

@item %Ps
Replaced by a list of source files in the root project.

@item %prs
Replaced by a list of files in the current project, and all imported
subprojects, recursively.

@item %prdf
Replaced by the name of a file that contains a list of source
directories in the current project, and all imported subprojects,
recursively.
@end table

@section Customizing the Tool Bar
@noindent

@node Changing Colors Fonts and Key Bindings
@section Changing Colors Fonts and Key Bindings
@noindent

In addition to the preferences dialog, GPS can be configured through the
Gtk+ mechanism of @file{rc files}. You can create a text file called
@file{gtkrc} in the gps home directory (@file{~/.gps} on Unix systems), or as
a global change, in the directory etc/gps in the GPS installation. This file
contains the usual configuration description, following the gtk resource
files syntax.

Special effects can be achieved this way. For instance, the following
code will change the background color of any button, when it is
pressed. It will also set a background pixmap when it is not pressed.
The style also inherits from the one above, so that the buttons also
use the default font.

@smallexample
pixmap_path "<directory_that_contains_the_pixmap>"
style "button" = "default" @{
  bg_pixmap[NORMAL]="<pixmap_name>"
  bg[ACTIVE]="blue"
@}
class "*GtkButton*" style "button"
@end smallexample

Similarly, you can configure the key bindings to suit your habits. In
the editor, you can for instance set @key{Ctrl-V} to scroll forward
one page, as usual under the Emacs editor. The following code takes
care of that. Configuring keys is trickier than the above, since you
need to know the signals that the widgets can receive. Basically, the
most useful will probably be @option{move_cursor}. The first
parameter should be one of @option{pages}, @option{paragraphs},
@option{words}, @option{display-lines} or
@option{logical-positions}. The second parameter is the number of
such units to skip

@smallexample
binding "custombind" @{
   bind "<ctrl>v" @{ "move_cursor" (pages, 1, 0) @}
@}
class "*GtkTextView*" binding : highest "custombind"
@end smallexample

Enabling key bindings similar to the popular Emacs editor is even
easier, since you can specify it directly in the preferences dialog.

@noindent
If you would like to make suggestions about GPS, or if you encountered a bug,
please report it to @uref{mailto:report@@gnat.com} following the usual GNAT
reports recommendations as explained in the file README.GNATPRO.

Please try to include a detailed description of the problem, including
sources to reproduce it if possible/needed, and/or a scenario describing the
actions performed to reproduce the problem, as well as the tools (e.g
@i{debugger}, @i{compiler}) involved.

The files @file{$HOME/.gps/log} and @file{$HOME/.gps/debugger.log} may also
bring some useful information when reporting a bug.

This section addresses some common problems that arise when installing GPS
on a new machine.

@table @samp

@item Non-priviledged users cannot start GPS
Q: I have installed GPS originally as super user, and ran GPS successfully,
but normal users can't.

A: You should check the permissions of the directory $HOME/.gps and its
subdirectories, they should be owned by the user.

@item GPS crashes whenever I open a source editor
This is usually due to font problems. Typically, editing the file
@file{$HOME/.gps/preferences} and changing the name of the fonts, e.g
changing @i{Courier} by @i{Courier Medium}, and @i{Helvetica} by @i{Sans}.

@item GPS refuses to start the debugger
If GPS cannot properly initialize the debugger (using the menu
@code{Debug->Initialize}), it is usually because the underlying debugger
(gdb) cannot be launched properly. To verify this, try to launch the
'gdb' command from a shell (i.e outside GPS). If gdb cannot be launched from
a shell, it usually means that you are using a wrong version of gdb
(e.g a version of gdb built for Solaris 8, but run on Solaris 2.6).
