***********************
Project View (entities)
***********************

Click on the triangle to open :file:`tokens.ads` entities. When you click on a
file in the project view, you see language sensitive information about the
file, such as `packages`, `subprograms`, and `tasks` for `Ada`.

Open the `subprogram` category, then click on `Process`: this will open
`tokens.ads` and move the cursor to the first line of the procedure `Process`.

Similarly, click on `Next` and move your mouse to `Next` in the source editor.
