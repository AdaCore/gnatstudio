This document provides a guide through the major capabilities of the GNAT
Programming Studio by working on a code example: sdc, a simple desktop
calculator.

It is important to realize that the features that you are about to experiment
with are available on multiple platforms, using the same user interface and
capabilities, providing a user-friendly environment with a tight integration
between the tools.

Start GPS in the directory containing the tutorial files, or if the directory
is read-only, copy the :file:`tutorial` directory and its subdirectories in a
local (writable) area, and start GPS from the :file:`tutorial` directory, so
that GPS will load the right context.

By default, the tutorial sources can be found under
`<prefix>/share/examples/gps/tutorial`, where `<prefix>` is the prefix
directory of the GPS installation.

Alternatively, if you have already started GPS in another directory, you can
load the project `sdc.gpr` by using the menu `File->Open Project...`
