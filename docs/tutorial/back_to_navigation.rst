Back to Source Navigation

Move the mouse over the `Next` identifier in :file:`tokens.ads` editor, and
then hold the :kbd:`Control` key: while you're holding the key, move the mouse
over entities: these entities now become clickable hyperlinks. Clicking on the
first mouse button will go to the declaration of the entity highlighted (or the
body if you are already on the declaration), and clicking on the middle mouse
button will go to the body directly: move the mouse back to `Next` and click.
Alternatively, you can use the contextual menu and select `Goto body of
Next`; then scroll through the procedure `Next`, move the mouse on
`Instructions.Read` at line 46, hold :kbd:`control` again and click with the
middle mouse button (or from the contextual menu, select `Goto body of Read`).

We've now navigated quite a bit through the application source code, which you
can verify by clicking on the left arrow in the tool bar, to go back to the
previous locations visited.

Repeat the operation until you're back in :file:`sdc.adb`.  As with the
undo/redo capability in the source editor, the `goto previous/next location` is
infinite.
