This terminates our tour of GPS, the GNAT Programming Studio.
We hope this tutorial gave you a good overview of the general capabilities
available with GPS. A non exhaustive list of the features not mentioned in
this document includes:

* Documentation generation
* Automatic generation of body files
* Pretty printing
* Visual comparison of files
* Version control
* Flexible multiple document interface
* Code coverage

For more information, please look at the *User's Guide* (`gps.html
<gps.html>`_), and also look at the `Tools` menu which gives access to most of
these capabilities.
