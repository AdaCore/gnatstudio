Approximate search :feature:`(GPS -- 2013-06-25 -- M625-005)`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GPS is now able to do approximate search when the search is started
from the global search field. For instance, searching for "saerch" will
also match "search" when this mode is activated.
