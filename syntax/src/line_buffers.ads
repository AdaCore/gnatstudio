   -- Line Buffer Handling --
   --------------------------

   --  The line buffer represents a buffer (e.g contents of a file) line
   --  by line. Line separators (LF or CR/LF) are kept at the end of the buffer
   --  It is recommended to take advantage of the bound information that comes
   --  with a String_Access so that there can be a direct mapping between
   --  the original raw buffer and a line buffer.
   --  Len is used to keep the length of the original line stored. Since this
   --  type is intended for making changes in buffers at a minimal cost
   --  (e.g avoiding copies of complete buffers when inserting a few
   --  characters), being able to convert from the original buffer's position
   --  information to the line buffer is critical and is achieved using the Len
   --  field.
