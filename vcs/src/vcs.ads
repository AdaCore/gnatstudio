package VCS is

   --  This package provides utilities for communicating with a VCS
   --  repository. It provides a general architecture which is common
   --  to all VCS systems.
   --
   --  Depending on what the underlying VCS is like, some operations might
   --  be more costly than others,
   --  Therefore we provide two kinds of access to a VCS repository :
   --  either by reading multiple entries at a time,
   --  or by reading one entry at a time.
   --
   --  All queries are configurable, ie the amount of information
   --  that we communicate can be decided by the user.

   type VCS_Record is abstract tagged limited private;
   --  A value used to reference a VCS repository.

   type VCS_Access is access all VCS_Record'Class;
