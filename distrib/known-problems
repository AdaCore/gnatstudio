Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.0.1

- Incorrect project file set when spawning external Emacs editor
  Problem:    It might happen that the project file used in the external Emacs
              editors spawned by GPS is not the same one as in GPS.
  Workaround: Explicitely load the project file through the menu Project->Load
              in Emacs.

- Newly created projects sometimes have external variables
  Problem:    If you have loaded a project with external variables in GPS,
              the new projects created through Project->New will inherit
              these variables.
  Workaround: Remove the variables from the newly created projects by clicking
              on the icon beside the variable's name in the explorer

- No cross-reference for overloaded entities in C/C++
  Problem:    When selecting "goto declaration" for a C/C++ entity that has 
              multiple possible definitions (either overloaded or in a
              pre-processor section), GPS failed, when a dialog should have
              been displayed.
  Workaround: Select the correct declaration directly in the explorer

- Incorrect search when starting from middle of a line
  Problem:    If you start a search when you cursor is not in the first
              column and there is a match on that line, that match is
              incorrectly highlighted.
  Workaround: Look forward a few columns on the same line, you will see the
              occurence.

- Editing switches for a specific file from an open editor doesn't work
  Problem:    From an editor, if you display the contextual menu and select
              the edit switches item, GPS doesn't display the dialog.
  Workaround: Edit the switches by selecting the file in the project explorer

- Deleting scenario variables sometimes generates an incorrect project
  Problem:    When clicking on the trash button next to a scenario variable
              (at the top of the project explorer), this will sometimes
              report an internal error.
  Workaround: Try setting other values for the variable before removing it.
              Last chance is to edit the project by hand, or keep the variable
              around, but always modify all the possible values in the project
              properties editor.

- Incorrect language detection for files in the Ada naming scheme exceptions
  Problem:    If you create a project with some naming exceptions for some Ada
              files, these files will be incorrectly open in the editor (no
              highlighting, cross-references,...). Same thing in the explorer
  Workaround: Create a link to this special files, whose name should respect
              the standard naming scheme you have defined
