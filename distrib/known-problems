Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.2.0

- C222-002 Problem with save as null extension under Windows
  Problem:    Under Windows platforms only, when creating a file with no
              extension, a default .ads extension is always added.
  Workaround: Create an empty file with the right name outside of GPS, and
              then load it and edit it in GPS.

- No GPS window when unknown project specified on the command line
  Problem:    If a non-existing project file is specified on the command line
              with the -P parameter, the GPS window didn't appear on the screen
  Workaround: Make sure the file exists when specified on the command line

- OK button not selected in the "Open From Project" dialog the second time
  Problem:    When the dialog File->Open From Project is displayed, pressing
              enter will automatically open the file. However, this no longer
              worked the second time.
  Workaround: Press Alt+O instead

- C227-001 Last line of file not saved properly
  Problem:    In some cases when saving a file, the last character is
              truncated.
  Workaround: Add an extra blank line at the end of the file before saving it.

- C218-012 Drive letters not supported under Windows
  Problem:    The drive letters are not properly supported in the directory
              selector.
  Workaround: Change the current directory the the desired drive before using
              the directory selector, or type the full path directly.

- C130-023 Crash when opening multiple new files
  Problem:    When opening new files using the menu File->New or the
              toolbar icon, opening multiple new files when the line numbers
              are displayed causes GPS to crash.
  Workaround: In the preferences dialog, disable the "Display line numbers"
              preference in the Editor section.

- C128-002 Crash when searching in files containing CR characters
  Problem:    When searching in a file containing CR with no corresponding
              LF characters, GPS sometimes crashes or behaves in an unreliable
              way.
  Workaround: Save the file as Unix or Windows format.

- C117-005 Crash when adding lines in new file
  Problem:    When editing a new file while the line numbers are displayed,
              adding a few lines will cause GPS to crash.
  Workaround: Disable the "Display line numbers" preference.

- C116-002 Current line highlighting sometimes highlights multiple lines.
  Problem:    In some cases, for example when Reverting a file from the disk,
              the color that is used to highlight the current line is visible
              on multiple lines.
  Workaround: Scroll the editor or move the cursor to remove the extra
              highlighting.

- C105-001 Mismatch between files and VCS logs.
  Problem:    In some cases, the VCS log files do not correspond to the right
              files, or GPS cannot read the mapping file, and therefore
              cannot start.
  Workaround: Remove all the files in the log_files subdirectory in the GPS
              directory.

- Bad handling of item icon when saving new file
  Problem:    After saving an untitled file, the icon corresponding to the
              editor still shows the "modified" icon.
  Workaround: Save the file twice.

- Extended project nodes duplicated in explorer when recomputing view
  Problem:    If your project hierarchy includes extended project, and you
              select the menu Project->Recompute View, the extended project
              nodes are duplicated, and the exec directories disappear
  Workaround: Reload the project through Project->Recent instead

- BC04-009 Annoying scrolling when switching tabs
  Problem:    When switching from an editor to another, the editors scroll
              back to the place where their cursor is set, not to the point
              that was viewed the most recently.
  Workaround: Set the cursor within the viewed area before switching.

- Inconsistency between debugger dot colors when showing lines with code
  Problem:    When the debugger preference "show lines with code" is set,
              unsetting a breakpoint will leave a blue dot.
  Workaround: Always enable the "show lines with code" preference.
