Known Problems fixed in GPS 2.1.0

- D515-001 "Tasks are running" window shows internal processings of GPS
  Problem:    When launching GPS and exiting quickly, or when exiting right
              after opening a new editor, GPS opens the "Tasks are running"
              window and shows internal GPS commands.
  Workaround: These messages can safely be ignored.

- Using "Locate in explorer" from VCS Explorer doesn't work
  Problem:    When using the contextual menu on an entry in the VCS Explorer
              and using "Locate in Explorer: ...", nothing happens.
  Workaround: Double-click on the entry to open the file, and use "Locate in
              explorer" on the file editor.

- Changing size of a font resets its color
  Problem:    In the preferences dialog, changing the size of a font resets
              its foreground and background colors to the default values.
  Workaround: Set the color again explicitely.

- D614-009 Errors in C files are not displayed in the Locations window
  Problem:    Under Windows, the errors produced by compilation of C files are
              not visible in the Locations window.
  Workaround: Open the Preferences, in the "Messages" section, and change the
              "File pattern" entry to
                 "^([^:]:?[^:]*):(\d+):((\d+):)? ((warning)?(\(style)?.*)".

- D531-001 Over alignment of variable declarations
  Problem:    When aligning the colon (':') character in variable declarations,
              the computation is not stopped when encountering a blank line.
  Workaround: Indent manually when needed.
