Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.4.0

- H904-015: Files status disappearing from VCS Explorer
  Problem:    When committing a file or editing a revision log file
              statuses (Needs update and Needs merge) are disappearing
              from the VCS Explorer.
  Workaround: Launch a Query Status action to get back the statuses.

- HB21-038: Cannot use native Win32 aspell program with ispell plug-in
  Problem:    If you enable the ispell.py plug-in, GPS appears to hang when
              using the native Win32 aspell program and will never report any
              spelling errors.
  Workaround: Use a Cygwin version of aspell.

- HB17-006: Wrong coverage highlighting
  Problem:    GPS doesn't update the list of uncovered lines in the locations
	      window after reloading coverage information for a single file.
	      As a side effect covered lines may be highlighted as uncovered
              lines.
  Workaround: Hide and show coverage information for the file using the source
	      editor's contextual menu after reloading coverage information.

- HB04-009: Debugger console has no keyboard focus on title click
  Problem:    If you click in the title bar or the tab of the debugger
              console, the cursor is not activated in the console, and
              you need to click inside it before typing
  Workaround: Click in the middle of the console to give it focus

- D502-003: Procedure name too long and overlap with VCS status
  Problem:    On the editor's status bar if a procedure name is
              too long it will overlap with the VCS status.
  Workaround: Use the VCS Explorer which displays the proper status
