Known Problems fixed in GPS 5.3.0 / GNATbench 2.8.0

- M119-001: GPS: crash when loading an erroneous project template
  Problem:    If you write a custom project template (.gpt) file, GPS will
              crash if the "Category" field is blank.
  Workaround: Make sure to enter a "Category" field in the .gpt file.

- M115-022: ECL: Android library not found when running app
  Problem:    The Ada project builder creates a folder in the associated
              Android project to hold the resulting dynamic library. This
              folder is named "libs/armeabi-v7a/" but that name is specific to
              that architecture. As a result, the Android OS will only load the
              library if the target architecture is compatible with the v7a
              version.
  Workaround: Rename the folder to remove the "-v7a" suffix if the target is
              indeed incompatible.  For a permanent fix, change the content of
              file "postbuild.mk" so that the value of ANDROID_TARGET_VERSION
              is "armeabi" instead.  Subsequent Ada builds will then create a
              libs folder with the more architecture-independent name.

- M103-017: Write references reported as read references
  Problem:    Variables passed in out-mode parameters are not listed as
              as write references.
  Workaround: None.

- LC11-030: GPS: Potential conflict when redefining key shortcuts
  Problem:    It is possible to associate by mistake key shortcuts to keys
              that are already bound because the key manager dialog does not
              display a warning for some keys (such as ctrl-f).
  Workaround: Verify the absence of collisions manually.

- LB30-018: Missing references with extending projects
  Problem:    If you are using extending projects, GPS will not
              parse its .ali files (containing the xref information generated
              by the compiler) if the corresponding source file does not
              exist in the extending project but only in the extended project.
  Workaround: Copying the source files from the extended project into the
              extending project will solve this issue, but is not very
              convenient.

- LB26-008: GPS: Smart completion of C/C++ parameters
  Problem:    When a function/method has several parameters, we press the
              open parenthesis, and we choose smart completion of all the
              parameters at once, then the number of added parameters added
              by GPS is correct but their names (shown as comments) is wrong.
  Workaround: Fix the name of the parameters manually.

- LB21-056: GB: Preview pane hidden on project unit name wizard page
  Problem:    When converting an existing project to an Ada project, the
              preview pane on the wizard page where you select the project
              unit name is hidden.
  Workaround: Edit the project unit name.

- LB21-035: GPS: wrong &lt char in locations
  Problem:    In Location View text created through scripting API has
              escaped markup characters.
  Workaround: None.

- LB21-033: GPS: Codefix of expanded names in redundant conversions
  Problem:    Fixing automatically warnings on redundant type conversions
              fails if the target type is an expanded name (that is, when
              the target type has a prefix like "x.y.t").
  Workaround: Avoid automatically fixing the code when the warning is reported
              in an expanded name.

- LB15-004: GB: Renaming gnatbench gpr file causes gnatbench properties issues
  Problem:    When renaming a gpr file and then updating gnatbench properties,
              if the project file name is not consistent with the gpr file
              name, Eclipse will crash.
  Workaround: Modify the project name in the gpr file to be consistent with the
              gpr filename.

- LB14-054: GPS: keyboard shortcuts not functional when Caps Lock is active
  Problem:    When Caps Lock is active, letter-based keyboard shortcuts for
              GPS actions do not work.
  Workaround: Create a wrapper action, bound to the capitalized version of the
              letter.

- LB13-012: GPS: The contextual menu to close other editors has been removed
  Problem:    The contextual menu appearing on notebook tabs to close other
              editors has been removed.
  Workaround: Use the menu File -> Close All Editors Except Current instead.

- LA23-019: Bad indentation of access procedure type in generic declaration
  Problem:    When indenting code of the form:
              generic
                 type T is access procedure;
              The indentation engine gets confused and wrongly indents the
              following statements.
  Workaround: Fix the indentation manually.

- LA12-039: GB: Excluded_Source_List_File change not applied
  Problem:    When using the Excluded_Source_List_File attribute, and entering
              an invalid file name in the referenced text file, an error
              is generated about the incorrect file name, even when fixing
              the file name manually or cleaning the project.
  Workaround: Restart Eclipse.

- LA12-034: GPS: wrong menu for target with custom name in extending project
  Problem:    When using an extending project which defines an executable name
              for a main which is defined in the extended project, GPS does not
              display the custom name in the "Run" menu, and the corresponding
              target cannot be launched through the menu or the toolbar button.
  Workaround: Use the Build->Run->Custom... menu

- LA11-026: GPS: C/C++ completion of entities defined in header files
  Problem:    GPS does not propose a list of entities for completion when the
              type of the prefix is defined in a header file.

  Workaround: Include manually the file.

- LA11-003: No xref from separate units compiled explicitly
  Problem:    If you use separate Ada units, and compile them explicitly from
              the editor (for instance /Build/Compile File), then no
              cross-reference is available anymore for that file.
  Workaround: force the loading of all xref in memory, through
              /Build/Load Xref In Memory.
