Known Problems fixed in GPS 2.1.0

- D817-008 Closing the Run window does not always terminate execution.
  Problem:    In particular under Windows, and with multi-threaded programs,
              closing the Run window does not terminate the execution.
  Workaround: Terminate the program using "kill" (under UNIX) or the Windows
              task manager.

- D816-007 Double-clicking does not select identifiers containing digits
  Problem:    When an identifier contain digits, double-clicking on it does not
              select the entire word.
  Workaround: Select the identifier manually.

- D806-007 Selecting text and pressing enter does not delete the selection
  Problem:    When there is a selection in an editor that has auto-indentation
              capabilities, the text is not deleted when pressing enter.
  Workaround: Delete the text by pressing delete.

- D804-011 Focus switch leaves the editors in interactive selection mode
  Problem:    When selecting text in editors using the mouse, if an external
              window grabs the focus, the editor is stuck in selection mode and
              GPS might crash when closing this editor.
  Workaround: There is no workaround for this problem.

- D721-004 Typing in floating read-only editors writes in other editors
  Problem:    When you type characters in a read-only floating editor, the
              actual editing might occur in a non-floating editor instead.
  Workaround: Do not type in read-only floating editors.

- D715-006 Drag-and-drop a window on another floating window fails
  Problem:    If you are trying to make a window floating by dragging it
              and dropping over an already floating window, GPS will in
              fact put the new window in one of its docks instead of
              floating it.
  Workaround: Drop the window outside any GPS window, floating or not

- D707-010 In the Locations View, line numbers are hard to read
  Problem:     On the currently selected line in the locations view, the line
               and column number are written in black on a dark blue background
               and are therefore hard to read.
  Workaround:  Select another line or give the focus to another component.

- D615-009 References highlighting is confused by TABs
  Problem     When navigating through search results in the Locations view,
              the highlighting is wrong on lines that contain TABs before the
              reference.
  Workaround: There is no known workaround.

- D515-001 "Tasks are running" window shows internal processings of GPS
  Problem:    When launching GPS and exiting quickly, or when exiting right
              after opening a new editor, GPS opens the "Tasks are running"
              window and shows internal GPS commands.
  Workaround: These messages can safely be ignored.

- Using "Locate in explorer" from VCS Explorer doesn't work
  Problem:    When using the contextual menu on an entry in the VCS Explorer
              and using "Locate in Explorer: ...", nothing happens.
  Workaround: Double-click on the entry to open the file, and use "Locate in
              explorer" on the file editor.

- Changing size of a font resets its color
  Problem:    In the preferences dialog, changing the size of a font resets
              its foreground and background colors to the default values.
  Workaround: Set the color again explicitely.

- D614-009 Errors in C files are not displayed in the Locations window
  Problem:    Under Windows, the errors produced by compilation of C files are
              not visible in the Locations window.
  Workaround: Open the Preferences, in the "Messages" section, and change the
              "File pattern" entry to
                 "^([^:]:?[^:]*):(\d+):((\d+):)? ((warning)?(\(style)?.*)".

- D531-001 Over alignment of variable declarations
  Problem:    When aligning the colon (':') character in variable declarations,
              the computation is not stopped when encountering a blank line.
  Workaround: Indent manually when needed.
