Known Problems fixed in GPS 2.1.0

- VCS "List all files in projects [and subprojects]" does not work
  Problem:    When using CVS, Native ClearCase or any custom VCS, the menu
              operations to list files from projects do not list any file.
  Workaround: Use the "list files in directory" capabilities.

- D715-006 Drag-and-drop a window on another floating window fails
  Problem:    If you are trying to make a window floating by dragging it
              and dropping over an already floating window, GPS will in
              fact put the new window in one of its docks instead of
              floating it.
  Workaround: Drop the window outside any GPS window, floating or not

- D715-005 Regular expression search fails sometimes
  Problem:    When you search for a regular expression in a source editor,
              it happens that GPS highlights the first line of the editor
              instead of a matching line (this indicates there is a match,
              since you didn't get the "No match" dialog)
  Workaround: Search for a static string instead, although this will likely
              not be the exact same result the regular expression would
              have returned.

- D707-017 Unexpected paste operation under Windows
  Problem:    Under Windows, when scrolling using some mouse wheels, extra
              paste operations are sometimes performed during the scroll.
  Workaround: Scroll using the pg-up/down keys or the scrollbar.

- D707-010 In the Locations View, line numbers are hard to read
  Problem:     On the currently selected line in the locations view, the line
               and column number are written in black on a dark blue background
               and are therefore hard to read.
  Workaround:  Select another line or give the focus to another component.

- D525-001 GPS and Python on Windows
  Problem:    On Windows, GPS Python support does not work properly if GPS
              is installed on a directory whose name starts with a letter 'n',
              'r' or 't'.
  Workaround: Install GPS in another directory.

- D515-001 "Tasks are running" window shows internal processings of GPS
  Problem:    When launching GPS and exiting quickly, or when exiting right
              after opening a new editor, GPS opens the "Tasks are running"
              window and shows internal GPS commands.
  Workaround: These messages can safely be ignored.

- Using "Locate in explorer" from VCS Explorer doesn't work
  Problem:    When using the contextual menu on an entry in the VCS Explorer
              and using "Locate in Explorer: ...", nothing happens.
  Workaround: Double-click on the entry to open the file, and use "Locate in
              explorer" on the file editor.

- Changing size of a font resets its color
  Problem:    In the preferences dialog, changing the size of a font resets
              its foreground and background colors to the default values.
  Workaround: Set the color again explicitely.

- D614-009 Errors in C files are not displayed in the Locations window
  Problem:    Under Windows, the errors produced by compilation of C files are
              not visible in the Locations window.
  Workaround: Open the Preferences, in the "Messages" section, and change the
              "File pattern" entry to
                 "^([^:]:?[^:]*):(\d+):((\d+):)? ((warning)?(\(style)?.*)".

- D531-001 Over alignment of variable declarations
  Problem:    When aligning the colon (':') character in variable declarations,
              the computation is not stopped when encountering a blank line.
  Workaround: Indent manually when needed.
