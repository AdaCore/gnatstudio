Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.1.0

- F905-004 Executables listed twice for extending projects
  Problem:    If the project that is currently loaded explicitely mentions
              that its Main attribute is inherited from the extended project
              (for Main use Extended'Main) then all main files from the
              extended project will appear twice in the /Debug/Initialize
              menu.
  Workaround: No known workaround. In particular removing the reduntant
              inheritance clause will not solve the problem since the entry
              that will remain in the menu will be the wrong one.

- F823-029 GPS can't commit activity with capital letter files on win32
  Problem:    On Windows, using Cygwin based Subversion, it is not
              possible to check-in an activity (as an atomic commit) if
              some files are imported using Source_Files (instead of
              Source_Dirs) and have some capital letters on the pathname.
  Workaround: Do not use the group commit option or commit the files on the
              command line.

- F818-013 Interrupting GPS.Process in task manager doesn't kill it
  Problem:    If you spawn a process in a script through GPS.Process,
              and interrupt it via the GPS task manager, the process itself
              is not killed, although it disappears from the GPS task manager
  Workaround: Kill the process using "kill" or the Windows task manager

- F818-003 codefix bad with clause update
  Problem:    The auto-fix for messages like "non-visible declaration at 
              file:line" did not add the proper with / use statements, and the 
              entity was not correctly prefixed.
  Workaround: Fix manually the error, by adding the missing with, use, and / or
              prefix.

- F817-018 Cannot access menus with underscore from scripts
  Problem:    It isn't possible currently to execute a menu whose name
              contains an underscore from the script.
  Workaround: The underscore characters should be doubled

- F817-018 Cannot create custom toolbar separators
  Problem:    If you create an XML file with "<button/>" to insert a separator,
              nothing is done by GPS
  Workaround: None

- F816-014 Incorrect support of non-ASCII characters in file names
  Problem:    If the name of the source files includes non-ASCII characters,
              and the file system is not UTF8-encoded, then GPS will
              incorrectly display the list of source files in various places,
              such as the Project View
  Workaround: Avoid non-ASCII characters in file names

- F804-008 Cannot create key shortcuts for menus created from python
  Problem:    When a menu is created in python with GPS.Menu.create(), no
              key bindings can be defined for them through the
              /Edit/Key Shortcuts menu or gtk+'s dynamic key binding
  Workaround: Create an action (through "<action>" in XML), then associate a
              menu to it, and possibly a key shortcut as well

- F731-006 Cannot unset the F4 keybinding
  Problem:    F4 is by default assigning to building the first main unit.
              You cannot currently unset this key shortcuts through the dialog
              in /Edit/Key shortcuts, since GPS will keep recreating it from
              one session to the next
  Workaround: None found

- F731-004 Cannot change font for Window view and Project view
  Problem:    The font used in these views comes from the global gtk+
              theme set for the system, and cannot be changed from the
              GPS preferences
  Workaround: These fonts can be modified by creating a file ~/.gps/gtkrc
              to change gtk+ theme. On linux desktops, there is generally
              a more convenient system-wide configuration.

- F703-013 Compiling a file ignores extending projects
  Problem:    If you are using extending projects, and compile a file that is
              not overridden in the extending project, GPS compiles it in the
              context of the original project, but should really compile in
              the context of the extending project.
  Workaround: Use the menu /Build/Make/Custom... to enter your own custom
              compilation command

- F629-007 Status bar says line 0 when indentation disabled
  Problem:    Let's consider a source editor for which no automatic indentation
              is performed either because it as been explicitely disable in the
              preference dialog or because the corresponding language is
              unknown. Set the cursor at the end of the editor and press
              ENTER. At this point the status bar says the cursor is located
              on line 0 which is obvisously not the case.
  Workaround: Move the cursor a line up and then down again to force the
              refresh of the line information in the status bar. You can also
              type some text.

- F622-014 Key shortcuts and menu mnemonics
  Problem:    When you create a new key shortcut for an action, and when this
              shortcut matches one of the mnemonics used by gtk+ for menus, for
              instance alt-w for the Window menu, then the key shortcut is
              incorrectly displayed in the menus.
  Workaround: Although not visible, the shortcut works as expected
