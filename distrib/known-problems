- JA07-011 Location view and floating editors
  Problem:    When clicking in a location, the corresponding floating editor
              is not raised (no problem when the editor is not floating)

              click on the window to raise it.

- F622-029 Completion prefix error when the list is too large
  Problem:    When querying a smart completion, if the list is too large,
              the common prefix used to complete the current identifier may
              be wrong.

  Workaround: Manually complete the code.
