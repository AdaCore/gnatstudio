Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.0.1

- Editing switches for a specific file from an open editor doesn't work
  Problem:    From an editor, if you display the contextual menu and select
              the edit switches item, GPS doesn't display the dialog.
  Workaround: Edit the switches by selecting the file in the project explorer

- Deleting scenario variables sometimes generates an incorrect project
  Problem:    When clicking on the trash button next to a scenario variable
              (at the top of the project explorer), this will sometimes
              report an internal error.
  Workaround: Try setting other values for the variable before removing it.
              Last chance is to edit the project by hand, or keep the variable
              around, but always modify all the possible values in the project
              properties editor.

- Incorrect language detection for files in the Ada naming scheme exceptions
  Problem:    If you create a project with some naming exceptions for some Ada
              files, these files will be incorrectly open in the editor (no
              highlighting, cross-references,...). Same thing in the explorer
  Workaround: Create a link to this special files, whose name should respect
              the standard naming scheme you have defined
