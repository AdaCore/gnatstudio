Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.4.0

Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.3.0

- H915-002: File view from project filter no working
  Problem:    On the file view when activating the
              "Show files from project only" filter there is nothing
              displayed.
  Workaround: Do not activate the filter or use the project explorer

- H909-012: Wrong setting of gprbuild --target switch
  Problem:    When using a full pathname for the gnatmake command in the
              project file (e.g. "c:/gnatpro/bin/powerpc-elf-gnatmake"), GPS
              will launch gprbuild with the wrong --target switch.
  Workaround: Launch gprbuild using the Build->Make->Custom... menu, or use
              gprmake.

- H903-019: Generated documentation is displayed incorrectly with IE6
  Problem:    The documentation generator engine of GPS generates html code
              that uses the CSS style "white-space: pre;" which is not handled
              by IE6.
  Workaround: Use Firefox, IE7, Opera or Safari. They are known to handle
              correctly this CSS style.

- H902-002: Duplicate locations for SPARK Examiner error messages
  Problem:    If you use the spark module and examine a file, it happens
              that the location window has duplicate entries for error
              messages with lines greater than 100.
  Workaround: Ignore those extra lines, they have no impact on the result

- H805-023: Some references refered to as "read references"
  Problem:    When you search for references to an entity, GPS will report
              some of these as "read reference" when they really are just an
              occurrence of the name. The GNAT compiler does not make a
              distinction between the two cases, and such references are now
              marked as "reference"
  Workaround: None needed, this is just textual

- H730-020: List of main files cleared after a scenario change
  Problem:    When changing the value of a scenario variable for a project file
              that declares a main file with an empty name such as in:
                 for Main use ("");
              the list of main files in the Build/Make and Build/Run menus is
              cleared. Furthermore, those menus contain unexpected separators
              (one per main file with an empty name).
  Workaround: Although syntactically correct, this pattern has an undefined
              semantics. The right syntax to achieve the desireable goal is
              the following:
                 for Main use (); --  Note that double quotes have been removed

- H725-018: Refactoring->Rename does not ignore casing
  Problem:    When using the 'Rename' refactoring, identifiers are not
              considered with insensitive casing, thus failing to modify
              some occurrences
  Workaround: Use the Search & Replace capability instead.

- H725-002: Miscomputation of highlighling when using visual comparison
  Problem:    When using the visual comparison feature of GPS (via the
              /Tools/Compare/* or the /VCS/Compare* menus), the portion of
              lines that have been modified are highlighted. In some cases
              this fine grained highlighting will not appear at places it
              should.
  Workaround: No known workaround. As the line is modified, it will be
              be highlighted though, but the exact characters on the line that
              are modified will not.

- H724-004: Cannot search for package instantiation
  Problem:    If you use the contextual menu "Find References to ..." on a
              generic package, and then ask to only see its instantiations,
              you will currently not get any output
  Workaround: Look for "read references" to that package.

- H716-010: filedeps.py plug-in missing some dependencies
  Problem:    If you search, through this plug-in, why file A depends on file
              B, it is possible that the plug-in does not find any such
              dependency whereas the compiler detects one
  Workaround: Update the filedeps.py script. You do not need a new version of
              GPS.

- H714-013: Protection domains menu disabled with wtx4 debugger
  Problem:    The "Protection Domains" menu entry is not enabled when
              using a VxWorks653 wtx4-based debugger
  Workaround: Use the debugger console to access this information. Use
              "info pds" to list protection domains, and "pd <pd id>" to
	      switch between domains.

- H711-009: GPS hangs when closing and opening files
  Problem:    Under some circumstances, GPS might hang when opening a file
              and potentially crash. An identified scenario is when two new
              files are created using GPS, saved, closed, and opened again.
              A similar behavior can be observed when renaming a file.
  Workaround: Create new files or rename files outside GPS before loading them.

- H630-002: Incorrect file in xref after changing scenario
  Problem:    GPS incorrectly resets its internal xref cache when the scenario
              variables are changed. Do a query from file A, which ends into
              file B (for instance B contains the body of an entity referenced
              in A). Then change the scenario so that the object directories
              are now different, and B no longer belongs to the project. If
              you redo the same query as before, you will again end up in B,
              whereas you should end up in another file C instead.
  Workaround: Put the following python file in $HOME/.gps/plug-ins:
              import GPS
              def on_view_changed (h): GPS.reset_xref_db()
              GPS.Hook ("project_view_changed").add (on_view_changed)

- H612-018: GPS hangs when it cannot write to the log file
  Problem:    Due to special circumstances, GPS might not be able to write to
              the log file (e.g NFS errors) and as a result just hangs.
  Workaround: Remove the first line of the traces.cfg file that is located
              under %USERPROFILE%/.gps on Windows or $HOME/.gps/ on other
              platforms and which contains ">log.$$".

- H612-013: Inability to set breakpoints at some locations
  Problem:    Recent GNAT Pro packages comes with a new version of GDB (6.8)
              which makes use of a new feature that is not properly handled
              by GPS (multiple locations breakpoints). As a result it might not
              be possible to set breakpoints in some particular locations.
              Furthermore, after GPS refused to set a breakpoint, it is not
              possible to open the breakpoint editor. Finally, this can also
              generate some instabilities.
  Workaround: It can help to compile with no optimization (-O0). Otherwise it
              is still possible to use an older version of GDB (coming from a
              previous release of GNAT Pro).

- H704-007: Closing nodes in call graph still shows locations
  Problem:    If you select the contextual menu "... calls", you get a
              call tree, which shows location on its right-hand part. If
              you fold the toplevel node, the locations are still visible,
              although clicking on them has no effect
  Workaround: Expand the node again, and select the entity for which you
              want to see the locations.

- H611-032: File Dependencies plug-in fails
  Problem:    If you active the filedeps.py plugin, you see a new menu
              /Navigate/Show File Dependency Path. However, this menu will
              not work and report a python error
  Workaround: open the python console, and type the following command,
              replacing file names as appropriate:
              filedeps.print_dependency_path \
                (GPS.File ("file1"), GPS.File ("file2"))

- H606-009: Incorrect file loaded in debugger with extending project
  Problem:    If you are loading an extending project is GPS which does not
              explicitely overrides its parent's Main attribute, then an
              incorrect executable (the one from the parent project) will be
              loaded in the debugger
  Workaround: Define the Main attribute explicitely in the extending project.

- H604-001: Delay in scripts execution in batch mode
  Problem:    When launching GPS with the option "--load=<a script>", the
              script only gets executed after the end of all background tasks
              such as the loading of the entity database for the Smart
              Completion.
  Workaround: Disable the preferences/scripts that launch these background
              tasks (such as the Smart Completion).

- H602-007: Cannot write data into read-only files
  Problem:    GPS does not properly detect that a file is read-only.
              This prevents GPS from temporarily set the file to writable
              to save the content as it is supposed to happen.
  Workaround: Set manually the file to writable.

- H529-001: Separator for combo boxes not supported in XML files
  Problem:    If you defined a "separator" attribute for a <combo> switch
              in the XML files, that separator is ignored
  Workaround: None.

- H526-009: Subversion status not properly reported
  Problem:    The "Needs merge" status is reported as "Needs update" in the
              VCS Explorer.
  Workaround: Use Subversion from the command line to get proper status.

- H512-021: Visual Differences is slow
  Problem:    It can take a long time to compute Visual Differences (for
              instance through the menu Tools->Compare or through VCS queries.
  Workaround: Disable the computation of fine changes. This is done by
              setting the "Fine Change Color" preference to the same value as
              the "Change Color" preference, in the "Visual Diff" panel.

- H504-003: Subversion compare two revisions not working
  Problem:    The "Compare two revisions" VCS action is not working with
              Subversion. The action seems to be ignored and no error
              message is displayed.
  Workaround: Compare both versions from the command line.

- H427-004: Subversion head revisions log not displayed
  Problem:    In the VCS Subversion log output, the head revisions are not
              displayed if they correspond to changes not yet updated
              locally.
  Workaround: Do an update of the file before displaying the log.

- H415-015: Wrong file used when compiling a file with no project
  Problem:    When compiling a file which does not belong to the current
              project hierarchy and a file with the same basename exists
              in one of the projects, this file is compiled instead of
              generating an error message.
  Workaround: Make sure your files always belong to a project.

- H409-028: Fix the activity contextual menu with multiple selected files
  Problem:    When selecting multiple files on the VCS Explorer the
              activity oriented entries in the contextual menu where not
              always accurate. The menu "Commit as new Activity" or "Add to
              Activity" could be present even though a selected file was
              already in an activity. The menu "Remove from Activity" was
              not listed if the first selected file had no activity.
  Workaround: Select only files belonging to the same activity.

- H407-006: Confusion when editing scenario variables
  Problem:    The dialog used to edit a scenario variable appears
              confusing to some users, who expect that changing the Name
              will in fact select another existing variable. Documentation
              was updated, and the label in the dialog changed to "Rename to".
  Workaround: None needed.

- H327-025: No source directories displayed in the project explorer
  Problem:    When the project explorer hidden directories is empty
              all source directories are hidden in the project explorer.
  Workaround: Set the pattern to its default "^((\..+)|CVS)$" or do not
              filter the hidden directories (see option in project explorer
              contextual menu).

- H319-009 Coverage annotations missing in the editors
  Problem:    When querying the code coverage annotation on a source editor,
              no symbols appear in the margin to indicate which lines are
              covered and which lines are not.
  Workaround: The detailed information is present in the .gcov files and via
              tooltips.

- H316-002: Cannot remove multiple files from an activity using VCS Explorer
  Problem:    Files selected in the VCS Explorer cannot be removed from the
              activity.
  Workaround: Remove files using the VCS Activities explorer.

- H314-018: Cannot add a file into an activity
  Problem:    It is not possible to add a file into an activity using the
              Version Control contextual menu on the editor.
  Workaround: Use the VCS Explorer to add files into the activity.

- H312-026: Cannot display coverage information of C source files.
  Problem:    When trying to display a coverage report for a project containing
              C source files, the report does not contain all the source files
              of the project, and only one C file.
  Workaround: Load separately the coverage information of each Ada source file

- H311-032: Cannot close debugger multiple choice dialog under Windows
  Problem:    When debugging under Windows, and a multiple choice dialog is
              displayed (when e.g. putting a breakpoint on an overloaded
              function), the close button will not always work properly, and
              the underlying debugger may crash.
  Workaround: Use the 'cancel' choice and 'OK' button instead to close the
              dialog.

- H309-006: VCS revisions not properly updated
  Problem:    In some cases (when the VCS cache already contains
              revision information) the files statuses are not properly
              updated. For example after a commit, doing a Query status
              won't show the new revision number of the committed files.
  Workaround: Use the external VCS command to get the revision numbers.

- H307-006: Cannot add multiple files into an anonymous activity
  Problem:    When multiple files are selected in the VCS Explorer only
              the first selected file gets added into the anonymous
              activity when using the "Commit as new Activity" action.
  Workaround: Add each file individually.

- H227-011: ispell and isearch in floating windows
  Problem:    When you try to use one of the two plugins in a floating editor,
              the expected popup window is not displayed correctly. GPS might
              even crash depending on your environment.
  Workaround: Unfloat the editor before using these plugins

- H225-011: Closing a floating assembly view crashes GPS
  Problem:    Closing the assembly view after the debug session has been
              terminated may crash GPS if the assembly view was in floating
              mode.
  Workaround: Be sure to close the assembly view before terminating the debug
              session or unfloat it before closing it.

- H225-023: Cannot displaying anonymous structures from g++ 4.1
  Problem:    When trying to display an anonymous structure generated by
              a g++ compiler there is an extra dotted name (ie .1) confusing
              GPS.
  Workaround: Use the 'print' contextual menu to display the values in the
              debugger console instead.

- H222-027: Duplicate -gnaty in project after editing properties
  Problem:    In some cases, in particular when you are using -gnaty<digit>,
              the resulting project file has duplicate entries for -gnaty
              switches. In addition, this results in extra case statements
              generated in the project.
  Workaround: Edit the project manually.

- H222-027: Editing project properties changes casing in project name
  Problem:    If you edit the properties of a project, the casing of its name
              might be changed (words are capitalized, and any specific casing
              you previously had is lost).
  Workaround: Projects are really case insensitive, so this issue only affects
              you if you are also editing projects manually. In such a case,
              you will need to overwrite GPS change.

- H218-005: Exception in dispatching.py plug-in when closing buffers
  Problem:    If you have activated the dispatching.py plug-in (which highlights
              dispatching calls in Ada code), and close a buffer just after you
              open it, an error message is displayed in the Messages window.
  Workaround: Wait a while before closing the buffer (so that all highlighting
              is done). You can also simply ignore the error message, which has
              no side effect.

- H207-009: Infinite loop when computing the Dispatching Calls menu
  Problem:    In some cases, GPS might end up in an infinite loop when
              computing the list of entities that could possibly be called
              from a dispatching call.
  Workaround: The problem seems to appear mostly on simple projects. If that
              is a frequent issue to you, you can disable the dispatching call
              search by changing the preference "Submenu for dispatching calls"

- H204-015: Project files variable references on external default not supported
  Problem:    A project file using a variable reference to specify an
              external default value was not loaded properly.
  Workaround: Specify the default value as a literal string.

- H201-015: Crash when launching an external command producing lots of output
  Problem:    When GPS launches an external command defined through an
              <external> XML tag, for instance in custom scripts or predefined
              plugins such as the Metrics plugin, GPS might run out of memory
              and crash if the command launched produces a very large amount of
              output.
  Workaround: Make sure that the commands launched do not produce huge output.
              If needed, use a wrapper around the tool that will strip extra
              output and call this wrapper from GPS instead of directly the
              tool.

- H129-003: Tooltip not properly displayed
  Problem:    It sometimes appears that a tooltip does not contain the name
              of the underlying entity and a GTK+ warning might be emitted.
  Workaround: Close the tooltip and display it again.

- H124-016: Last long word not displayed in the memory view
  Problem:    Depending on the first address specified in the memory view and
              from which memory is read, the last long word might not be
              displayed and replaced with dashes instead.
  Workaround: Adjust the address from which memory is read or use the x/ command
              of GDB directly.

- H122-026: Changing Ada switches for a file does not work
  Problem:    When using the switches editor to change the switches associated
              with a particular file, changes are not taken into account and
              might lead to unexpected behaviors.
  Workaround: Specify the swithes directly in the project file.

- H117-021: Crash when expanding nodes in the Project Explorer
  Problem:    After checking or unchecking items in the Project Explorer
              contextual menu, GPS might crash or show unexpected
              behavior after expanding or collapsing nodes.
  Workaround: Restart GPS after having checked/unchecked items in the
              contextual menu.

- H115-022: Directories without source not hidden
  Problem:    Directories containing no source file are not hidden in the
              Project Explorer even-though the hidden directory pattern
              would match.
  Workaround: Edit the project file to remove the directories you want to
              hide.

- H108-001: Issues with floating windows.
  Problem:    GPS might hang upon starting if there is more than one floating
              window in the stored desktop.
  Workaround: Remove the file "desktop.xml" in the .gps directory.

- H103-004: Revisions not properly highlighted
  Problem:    When clicking on the revision links on annotated files, the
              corresponding revision is not highlighted if the revision is
              already  present in the Revision View.
  Workaround: Close the Revision View before clicking on the version links.

- GC19-004: "Debug->Interrupt" not working in remote mode when using rsh
  Problem:    When debugging a program in remote mode, using rsh, using
              "Interrupt" has no effect.
  Workaround: Use ssh instead.

- GC17-004: Editing project reverses the order of packages
  Problem:    When you edit a project that contains several packages, GPS
              reverts the order of the packages in the resulting file,
              instead of preserving it.
  Workaround: Edit the project a second time

- GC13-020: Option --debug looking for executables in PATH
  Problem:    When launching GPS with the option "--debug=executable", looks
              for executable in the PATH, instead of looking in the current
              directory first.
  Workaround: Specify the full path to the executable.

- GC07-025: Ouline View can't display large profile
  Problem:    Routines with a large profile (more than 50 parameters)
              won't be properly output in the outline view.
  Workaround: Disable the output of the routine profile.

- GC04-018: GPS not compatible with firefox 1.5
  Problem:    GPS is not compatible with firefox 1.5, which does not support
              the -new-tab switch. When you select an entry in the /Help menu,
              firefox is open but the file is not visible
  Workaround: copy-paste the URL from the GPS Messages window into the location
              bar in firefox

- GB20-003: VCS not properly detected for subprojects
  Problem:    When using a hierarchy of projects, if a subproject has a VCS set
              but the root project does not have a VCS set, GPS is unable to
              call VCS operations on sources belonging to the subproject.
  Workaround: Set a VCS on the root project.

- GA26-033: Start/Continue button restarts the program when in remote mode
  Problem:    When using GPS to debug a program using the "remote" protocol,
              the first push on the Start/Continue button causes the program
              to be restarted, instead of continuing the execution.
  Workaround: Type "cont" in the debugger console instead of pressing the
              Start/Continue button.

- G906-021: Auto fixing doesn't indent correctly "pragma Unreferenced"
  Problem:    When GPS insert a "pragma Unreferenced" to fix an unreferenced
              entity warning, the indentation of the pragma may be incorrect.
  Workaround: Manually fix the indentation.

- G621-018: Auto fixing cannot remove variables containing "is"
  Problem:    When a variable type or initialization contains the string "is",
              and is not referenced, the auto fix proposed by GPS doesn't
              manage to remove it properly.
  Workaround: Remove manually the variable.

- FA23-004: Mischosen "from" as parameter name in the python API
  Problem:    "from" had been chosen as a parameter name of several methods of
              the GPS.EditorBuffer class. As a result, it was not possible to
              use named parameters for these methods as "from" is a python
              keyword. It has been replaced with "frm".
  Workaround: Do not use named parameters for methods that have a formal
              parameter named "from".

- F427-020: GPS slow when displaying some text files
  Problem:    When editing some text files such as .texi files, GPS is
              sometimes very slow when inserting new characters.
  Workaround: Disable the synx higlighting by setting another language
              for the file.
