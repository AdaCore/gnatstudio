Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.4.0

- HC10-015: Wrong text replacement with auto-casing
  Problem:    When auto-casing is enabled in the preferences, the wrong
              text replacement can occur if there are single quotes in the text
              being considered.
  Workaround: Edit the wrong replacement manually.

- HC09-008: Bad handling of --display
  Problem:    The command line switch --display is not handled correctly by GPS
  Workaround: Set the environment variable DISPLAY instead. If you need to
              spawn applications from GPS to another display, you can write
              a small python plug-in that does:
                  import os; os.environ["DISPLAY"]="..."

- HB04-009: Debugger console has no keyboard focus on title click
  Problem:    If you click in the title bar or the tab of the debugger
              console, the cursor is not activated in the console, and
              you need to click inside it before typing
  Workaround: Click in the middle of the console to give it focus

- D502-003: Procedure name too long and overlap with VCS status
  Problem:    On the editor's status bar if a procedure name is
              too long it will overlap with the VCS status.
  Workaround: Use the VCS Explorer which displays the proper status
