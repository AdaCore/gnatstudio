Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.2.0

- G526-001 Incorrect display of block highlighting
  Problem:    In some very long source files, the block highlighing line may
              be drawn incorrectly on very large areas containing no block
              information.
  Workaround: The block highlighting line can be safely ignored.

- G517-001 Makefile.py plug-in: various fixes
  Problem:    Various minor issues were fixed in the Makefile plugin.
              When the project loaded from the command line defines the
              "make" package, no warning should be displayed in the console.
              When a scenario variable is changed, and the project then
              defines a new Makefile to use, this new value is not taken into
              account and the old Makefile is still used. Entries containing
              full path names are also not displayed correctly
  Workaround: this warning can be safely ignored

- G507-019 Some operations not working with "ClearCase Native" VCS.
  Problem:    When working on a project with "ClearCase Native" selected as
              Version Control system, the "Query status" and "Annotate"
              operations do not work.
  Workaround: Edit the "clearcase.xml" file in the directory share/gps/plug-ins
              from your GPS installation, look for the lines containing
              the "cleartool describe" and "cleartool annotate" commands, and
              replace the quoted blocks after "-fmt" with
                  "%%En\\n%%Xn\\n%%f\\n%%m %%Rf\\n"
              and "%%Sd\\040%%-16.16u\\040%%-40.39Vn:"

- G502-009 <on-failure> not executed whith empty <external> command
  Problem:    If you create an XML file with an action that executes an
              empty <external> command, an internal error is reported, but
              GPS doesn't execute the following <on-failure> node.
  Workaround: Make sure the command to execute cannot be empty

- G503-011 Bad indentation of single line C constructs
  Problem:    GPS does not properly unindent single line construct (statements
              with no {}), e.g:
              if (cond1)
                if (cond2)
                  do_x ();
              do_y ();   <- this line was incorrectly indented
  Workaround: Fix indentation manually, or use {} around statements.

- G427-022 Removing files from an activity makes GPS unstable
  Problem:    When removing files from an activity there is a memory
              corruption. This can make GPS unstable and it may exit.
  Workaround: Create a new activity instead of removing files from the
              current activity. Note that even if GPS crashes the
              activity information is properly saved, so when GPS is
              restarted no data are lost.

- G420-033 Edited project with custom language has unexpected changes
  Problem:    If you project uses one of the predefined languages other
              than Ada and C (e.g. "Project File"), then opening the project
              properties editor, and clicking on OK results in a change in
              the Naming package of your project. The resulting project
              results in a warning when loaded by GNAT
  Workaround: Define a dummy extension for the naming scheme of these extra
              languages, so that none of the extensions is empty

- G413-018 Python/Shell commands related to EditorView not working
  Problem:    Python/Shell commands related to the class EditorView, for
              example EditorView.goto or EditorView.cursor, might not return
              the right result when working on editors that contain folded
              blocks or "blank" lines (such as editors involved in Visual
              Comparisons).
  Workaround: Unfold all blocks and remove comparisons when using such commands
              on editors.

G412-023 Big items truncated in the debugger Data window

  Problem:    The content of some items in the debugger Data window migth be
              truncated.
              The maximum width and height of an item displayed in the Data
              window is now customizable through the Browsers section of the
              Preferences dialog. Upon a preference change, all items will be
              redrawn. This allows in particular to fully display big items.
  Workaround: In some cases you can display the truncated part in an item of
              its own instead of having one big items in which everyting is
              displayed directly.

- G323-009 Documentation gives wrong return type
  Problem:    When the parameter initialization of a function contains the
              reserved words "null" or "not", these words will go into the
              returned type of the documentation.
  Workaround  Ignore such documentation.

- G316-005 Auto-casing is confused by string quotes characters constants.
  Problem:    When a string quote character is used ('"' in Ada or C), and
              a string constant is following this character constant, then GPS
              will apply the casing inside the string.
  Workaround: Deactivate the auto-casing, or use a newline character after
              the string quote character.

- G306-007 Multiple dialogs appearing on key shortcuts.
  Problem:    Some dialogs, such as the "Continue Search?" dialog or the
              "Open File" dialog, might appear multiple times when launched
              through key shortcuts.
  Workaround: The extraneous dialogs can be closed safely.

- G225-003 Activity indicator show "busy" state when using some plug-ins
  Problem:    When using some plug-ins which launch a process in the
              background, such as the spell checking "ispell" plug-in,
              the GPS activity indicator in the top-right corner show
              a busy state while the process is running.
  Workaround: Refer to the Task Manager to determine activity status of GPS.

- G119-006 Extra line reformatted with the "align" plug-in
  Problem:    When the low bound of the selection is located before the
              first character of a line, this line gets reformatted although
              this is not very intuitive.
  Workaround: Be sure the cursor in on the last line you want to reformat.
              You can move the cursor with the keyboard arrows (while pressing
              SHIFT to keep the current selection) to make sure it is not
              actually located on the following line.

- FB30-007 Completion doesn't work on symbol operators
  Problem:    When completing symbol operators, for example A."+" (|, the
              completion engine doesn't provide any completion.
  Workaround: Manually complete the code.

- F907-001 Code fixing doesn't work with double quotes
  Problem:    When strings involves double quotes, the autofix process is
              sometimes unable to locate precisely where the fix has to be
              done.
  Workaround: Manually fix the error.

- DB25-010 Symbols not loaded when initializing cross debugger
  Problem:    When using GPS in a remote debugging configuration (ie, with the
              debugger running on a machine other than the executable being
              debugged) other than VxWorks environments, the underlying
              debugger does not load the debug symbols.
  Workaround: Load the symbols manually using the appropriate "file", "target"
              and "load" commands in the debugger console.
