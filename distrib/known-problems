Known Problems fixed in GPS 5.3.0 / GNATbench 2.8.0

- LA23-019: Bad indentation of access procedure type in generic declaration
  Problem:    When indenting code of the form:
              generic
                 type T is access procedure;
              The indentation engine gets confused and wrongly indents the
              following statements.
  Workaround: Fix the indentation manually.

- LA12-034: GPS: wrong menu for target with custom name in extending project
  Problem:    When using an extending project which defines an executable name
              for a main which is defined in the extended project, GPS does not
              display the custom name in the "Run" menu, and the corresponding
              target cannot be launched through the menu or the toolbar button.
  Workaround: Use the Build->Run->Custom... menu

- LA11-003: No xref from separate units compiled explicitly
  Problem:    If you use separate Ada units, and compile them explicitly from
              the editor (for instance /Build/Compile File), then no
              cross-reference is available anymore for that file.
  Workaround: force the loading of all xref in memory, through
              /Build/Load Xref In Memory.
