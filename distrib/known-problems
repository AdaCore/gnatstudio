- F629-007 Status bar says line 0 when indentation disabled
  Problem:    Let's consider a source editor for which no automatic indentation
              is performed either because it as been explicitely disable in the
              preference dialog or because the corresponding language is
              unknown. Set the cursor at the end of the editor and press
              ENTER. At this point the status bar says the cursor is located
              on line 0 which is obvisously not the case.
  Workaround: Move the cursor a line up and then down again to force the
              refresh of the line information in the status bar. You can also
              type some text.
