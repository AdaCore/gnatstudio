Known Problems fixed in GPS 5.1.0 / GNATbench 2.6.0

The following leading tags are used on the following entries to indicate:
GPS: this entry is specific to GPS
GB:  this entry is specific to GNATbench
WB:  this entry is specific to GNATbench for WorkBench
ECL: this entry is specific to GNATbench for Eclipse

If no tag is specified, the entry is relevant to all IDEs.

- JB30-029 The project editor takes too much time to open
  Problem:    When opening the project editor, a dialog "Scanning your computer
              for abailable compilers" appears and the project editor might
              be quite long to actually appear.
  Workaround: Verify your PATH environment variable, and in particular try to
              lower the number of network directories present in it. You can
              also manually edit the project file.

- JB24-033 References found in external files when sharing obj dir
  Problem:    If you have multiple projects sharing a common object
              directory, GPS will load the xref information from all the ALI
              files in that directory, even if the corresponding project is
              not loaded.
  Workaround: It is better not to share object directories among unrelated
              projects.

- JB19-027 GB: Makefile target descriptions not shown in dialog
  Problem:    When applying the "Invoke Makefile Target" menu entry, the
              resulting dialog shows the target name in the description field.
  Workaround: Look in the makefile itself for the description.

- JA26-031 Error when auto fixing a missing with when there is a pragma
  Problem:    When a file starts with a pragma, e.g. Pragma Ada_2012, and there
              is a missing with clause, the auto fix moves the fix before the
              pragma, resulting in an incompatible file.
  Workaround: Manually fix the file.

- JA12-020 Error when auto fixing type discriminants
  Problem:    When the compiler detects a mismatch between the partial and the
              full declaration of a type, with regards to the discriminants,
              the auto fix mechanism does't work and remove random characters.
  Workaround: Manually fix the code.

- JA07-011 GPS: Location view and floating editors
  Problem:    When clicking in a location, the corresponding floating editor
              is not raised (no problem when the editor is not floating)
  Workaround: Select the editor in the /Window menu to raise it, or simply
              click on the window to raise it.

- J914-003 Navigation errors when switching scenario variables
  Problem:    When switching back and forth scenario variables involving a
              change in the set of sources, the navigation may be confused
              and lead to files that are not in the current scenario.
  Workaround: Restart GPS / GNATbench and set the scenario on which navigation
              is expected.

- J902-019 Navigation without compilation doesn't work with UTF8
  Problem:    Navigation without compilation may not be available when there is
              UTF8 characters on the line.
  Workaround: Compile the file and then navigate.

- J302-007 No quick fixes for unreferenced type definitions
  Problem:    When an unreferenced type definition is detected by the compiler,
              no quick fix is offered to removed the type or add a pragma
              unreferenced.
  Workaround: Manually fix the code.

- GB21-006 Profile completion errors with formal parameters
  Problem:    Auto completion with formal parameters of subprogram calls may
              not insert the correct formal parameters if there are already
              unordered parameters given.
  Workaround: Manually complete the code.

- F622-029 GPS: Completion prefix error when the list is too large
  Problem:    In GPS, when querying a smart completion, if the list is too
              large, the common prefix used to complete the current identifier
              may be wrong.
  Workaround: Manually complete the code.
