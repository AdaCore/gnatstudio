Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.0.0

- IDE project attributes not taken into account
  Problem:    When setting values for the compiler or debugger, GPS will not
              take them into account when building or debugging.
  Workaround: Use a wrapper script called gnatmake (or gdb) that calls the
              proper tool (e.g powerpc-wrs-vxworks-gnatmake).
