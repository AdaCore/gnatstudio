Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.0.2

- B823-009 Crash at startup for project referencing external variables
  Problem:    If a project other than the root project references an external
              variable, and this variable isn't also referenced in the root
              project, GPS crashes on startup.
  Workaround: Set the variable in the environment before starting GPS, or
              reference the variable in the root project itself.

- B816-004 Crash in layout in the browsers
  Problem:    When a browser (call graph, dependencies,...) has lots of items
              displayed, it sometimes happens that the layout algorithm crashes
              and all the items are located in the top-left corner (or they
              appear to be a limitation in the number of items supported by the
              browser).
  Workaround: <none found>

Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.0.1

- B726-016 Crash when switching page in the preferences under Solaris
  Problem:    On solaris systems, switching to a page in the preferences dialog
              that contains color selection widget will make GPS crash.
              This is related to the X server asking for 8 bits pixmaps, but
              only accepting 24 bits
  Workaround: Edit the file ~/.gps/preferences manually instead of using the
              preferences dialog.

- B726-015 Crash when displaying tooltips under Solaris
  Problem:    When a tooltip should be displayed in the source editor on
              Solaris systems, GPS crashes. This is another instance of
              B726-016
  Workaround: Disable the tooltips by editing the preferences file manually.

- B702-004 Exception raises when processing Ada separate units
  Problem:    When GPS displays tooltips or computes cross-references on a
              separate unit, it crashes.
  Workaround: <none found>

- B627-003 GPS crashes when ran locally under Solaris
  Problem:    When ran locally under some Solaris configurations, GPS crashes
              with a message similar to
              (g_string_append): assertion 'VAL != NULL' failed.
  Workaround: Set the environment variable CHARSET to ISO-8859-1.

- The highlighting from the debugger stayed after the debugger ends.
  Problem:    When the debugger highlights lines of code, the highlighting
              remains after the debugger terminates.
  Workaround: Close the related files and re-open them.

- Incorrect project file set when spawning external Emacs editor
  Problem:    It might happen that the project file used in the external Emacs
              editors spawned by GPS is not the same one as in GPS.
  Workaround: Explicitely load the project file through the menu Project->Load
              in Emacs.

- Newly created projects sometimes have external variables
  Problem:    If you have loaded a project with external variables in GPS,
              the new projects created through Project->New will inherit
              these variables.
  Workaround: Remove the variables from the newly created projects by clicking
              on the icon beside the variable's name in the explorer

- No cross-reference for overloaded entities in C/C++
  Problem:    When selecting "goto declaration" for a C/C++ entity that has
              multiple possible definitions (either overloaded or in a
              pre-processor section), GPS failed, when a dialog should have
              been displayed.
  Workaround: Select the correct declaration directly in the explorer

- Incorrect search when starting from middle of a line
  Problem:    If you start a search when you cursor is not in the first
              column and there is a match on that line, that match is
              incorrectly highlighted.
  Workaround: Look forward a few columns on the same line, you will see the
              occurence.

- Editing switches for a specific file from an open editor doesn't work
  Problem:    From an editor, if you display the contextual menu and select
              the edit switches item, GPS doesn't display the dialog.
  Workaround: Edit the switches by selecting the file in the project explorer

- Deleting scenario variables sometimes generates an incorrect project
  Problem:    When clicking on the trash button next to a scenario variable
              (at the top of the project explorer), this will sometimes
              report an internal error.
  Workaround: Try setting other values for the variable before removing it.
              Last chance is to edit the project by hand, or keep the variable
              around, but always modify all the possible values in the project
              properties editor.

- Incorrect language detection for files in the Ada naming scheme exceptions
  Problem:    If you create a project with some naming exceptions for some Ada
              files, these files will be incorrectly open in the editor (no
              highlighting, cross-references,...). Same thing in the explorer
  Workaround: Create a link to this special files, whose name should respect
              the standard naming scheme you have defined
