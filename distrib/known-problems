- LA11-013: Aspect clause on a record confuses indentation
  Problem:    When using an Ada 2012 aspect clause at the end of a record,
              the indentation engine may get confused and unindent an extra
              level wrongly, e.g:
                 type R is record
                    X : Integer;
                 end record with Size => 32;
  Workaround: Use a 'for' clause instead to specify the aspect.
