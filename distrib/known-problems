- D602-016 Duplicate Build menu entries with extending projects
  Problem:    If you are using extending projects, the Build->Make menu
              will contain apparently duplicate entries.
  Workaround: In fact, these entries will build the same executable, but using

- D415-005 Execution window is read-only after the first execution
  Problem:    If you run an external program using the menu Build->Run,
              after the process exits, the execution window becomes read-only
              and cannot be used to input text in following executions of the
              program.
  Workaround: Close the execution window before executing the second time.
