Known Problems fixed in GPS 5.1.2 / GNATbench 2.6.1

- L113-030: GPS: Drag and drop in the editor leaves text in original position
  Problem:    When using drag-and-drop to move text in an editor, the text
              is inserted at the drop location, but the original text remains
              in place.
  Workaround: Cut and paste the text manually.

- L110-032: GPS: cannot switch tasks with recent versions of GDB
  Problem:    When using GDB 7.3, it is not possible to switch between tasks
              in the Tasks view, and the task information in this view
              can  be displayed in the wrong column.
  Workaround: Use the Debugger Console: "info tasks" to list tasks, and
              "task N" to switch to task number N.

- L106-022: GPS: Editor jumps when clicking after "Continue search" dialog
  Problem:    When using the keyboard shortcuts to search (ctrl-n and ctrl-p),
              if the "Continue search" dialog appears, clicking on an entity
              will cause the the editor to jump to the declaration of this
              entity.
  Workaround: Press and release the ctrl key, or click outside of an entity.

Known Problems fixed in GPS 5.1.1 / GNATbench 2.6.1

- KC01-003: GPS: Changing the gtk theme may make GPS crash
  Problem:    Seen in particular on Windows, changing the gtk theme from
              "MS-Windows" to "Raleigh" makes GPS crash.
  Workaround: Edit manually your preferences ~/.gps/preferences to modify the
              theme name and restart GPS.

- KB30-016: GPS: GNAT version not available in /Help/About
  Problem:    The menu /Help/About does not show the version of the GNAT
              compiler.
  Workaround: Open a console through /Tools/Consoles/OS Shell and execute
              gnatls -v

- KB29-013: GPS: speedbar marks for CodePeer messages not displayed
  Problem:    The color marks on the side of source editors are not displayed
              for CodePeer messages.
  Workaround: Use the location view instead to navigate between messages.

- KB28-040: GPS: crash when reloading a project that contains errors
  Problem:    When using the menu /Project/Reload Project and the project
              was modified manually and now contains errors, GPS reports
              an unexpected exception and terminates.
  Workaround: If you have doubt on your manual changes, try spawning a new
              GPS to test it first. If the project is correct, you can then
              reload it in your initial GPS.

- KB18-019: GPS: fold/unfold may change text
  Problem:    Unfolding a block may change the contents when two folding
              blocks are not separated by any blank line.
  Workaround: Insert a blank line between folding blocks.

- KB11-003: GPS: Contextual menu broken on Project nodes in the VCS Explorer
  Problem:    When using the contextual menu on the "Project" nodes in the
              VCS Explorer, the corresponding action is not executed.
  Workaround: Use the toplevel menu, or the contextual menu on projects in the
              Project view.

- KB10-052: GB: GNAT project file using relative path must be in the workspace.
  Problem:    Relative path for GNAT project file in the GNATbench properties
              pointing to a file located outside the workspace generates file
              not found problem errors.
  Workaround: If possible import the file in the workspace, otherwise make the
              path absolute.

- KA21-026: GPS: dispatching.py plug-in causes GPS to use 100% CPU
  Problem:    When the dispatching.py plug-in is active, certain conditions
              may cause GPS to start using 100% of the CPU, while the UI
              remains responsive.
  Workaround: Disable the dispatching.py plug-in via the Tools>Plug-ins menu.

- KA20-031: GPS: freeze when using custom diff options and DOS endings
  Problem:    When modifying the diff options to ignore whitespaces (for
              instance by modifying subversion.xml), GPS might hang when
              querying differences on files that contain CR/LF as line
              endings.
  Workaround: Use LF as line ending, or use standard diff options.

- KA18-030: GPS: hang using smart completion on multi-language project
  Problem:    GPS starts consuming too much CPU on large projects containing C
              and/or C++ files.
  Workaround: Disable Smart Completion in Preferences => Editor.

- KA14-011: Loading projects that use a Project_Path variable
  Problem:    GPS introduced support for aggregate projects and their new
              Project_Path list attribute. Unfortunately, if your own
              project defines a variable Project_Path, GPS fails to load it.
  Workaround: Rename the variable in all your projects.

- KA13-020: GPS: skeleton.py doesn't always insert header
  Problem:    If you activate the skeleton.py plugin, the extra text is only
              inserted for the first new file you create.
  Workaround: Save the first new file before opening a new one.

- KA10-001: GPS: Interrupting a remotely executed program may crash GPS
  Problem:    When executing a program in remote mode, and then interrupting
              it, then GPS may crash.
  Workaround: Kill the remote program manually.

- K125-013: GPS: problem examining files outside the project
  Problem:    GPS accepted to examine files outside the project but then was
              unable to locate the file when displaying error messages. GPS
              now refuses to examine such files by generating an error message.
  Workaround: Do not try to examine files outside the project, or modify the
              project source directories so that the file can be found.

- J423-002: GPS: Empty menu Help>GNAT Runtime
  Problem:    The menu that provides a convenient access to all the files in
              the GNAT runtime is empty.
  Workaround: Reuse the file share/gps/plug-ins/runtime.xml from a previous
              version of GPS.

Known Problems fixed in GPS 5.1.0 / GNATbench 2.6.0

- KA28-012: GB: Compatibility with Rational Team Concert source control
  Problem:    GNATbench failed to work with projects managed in RTC version
              control under Eclipse.
  Workaround: None known.

- KA20-035: GB: Internal error occurring during "loading construct database"
  Problem:    When opening GNATbench, an Ada project or saving a gpr file,
              a "Problem Occurred" window is displayed. It reports that an
              internal error occurred loading construct database.
              When asking for details, they can be:
              - index check failed near ada_analyzer.adb:3541
              - access check failed near language-tree.adb:79
  Workaround: None known.

- K920-014: GPS: Search and Replace in files with international characters
  Problem:    When launching a Search & Replace operation on files that are
              not viewed in an editor (for instance when replacing all
              occurrences in "Files from Project"), the files on disk might
              be corrupted if they contain international characters but are
              not encoded in UTF-8.
  Workaround: Replace interactively, or convert files to UTF-8 before using
              GPS to replace patterns in them.

- K902-006: GPS: Scenario variables not passed to gnat metric
  Problem:    When computing metrics from GPS, the scenario variables are not
              passed to the "gnat metric" tool, which results in errors when
              the project relies on scenario variables being defined.
  Workaround: Modify the project to use default values for the scenario
              variables, or launch "gnat metric" from the command line.

- K901-001: GPS: Message locations lost when reloading a file
  Problem:    When reloading an editor for a file that has been modified
              outside of GPS, the locations for messages (such as search
              results for instance) are lost.
  Workaround: Instead of reloading the editor, close it and re-open it.

- K831-018: GPS: Sort order of builder messages in Locations view
  Problem:    File items of builder result in Locations view are sorted in
              alphabetical order by default instead of being displayed in order
              of arrival.
  Workaround: Use the Messages window to find the proper order and search
              the corresponding items in the locations view using e.g. the
              filter pane.

- K831-011: GPS: Potential crash when generating lots of messages for one file
  Problem:    When GPS generates a lot of messages for one file (for instance
              as the result of a build containing many errors, or the use of
              the Coding Standard rule checker), GPS may crash.
  Workaround: None known.

- K829-030: GPS: Cannot replace with an empty string
  Problem:    When using the Search dialog to replace a pattern with the empty
              string, GPS does not replace the pattern.
  Workaround: Perform the replace manually.

- K828-001: GPS: Wrong line when searching in non-UTF8 files on disk
  Problem:    When GPS searches in files for which an editor is not open
              (for instance when searching in Files from project), if the
              files contain international characters but are not encoded
              in UTF-8, GPS might report wrong lines for the search results.
  Workaround: Open the files in an editor before searching, or convert files
              to UTF-8.

- K825-001: GPS: System fonts not found by default on RedHat 6
  Problem:    GPS does not list all of the system fonts on RedHat 6.
  Workaround: Set the environment variable FONTCONFIG_PATH to /etc/fonts

- K822-001: GPS: Extraneous entry box in the Target Configuration dialog
  Problem:    When selecting "custom" multiple times in the Icon field of the
              Target Configuration dialog, an extraneous text entry appears.
  Workaround: Do not select "custom" multiple times in a row.

- K811-017: GB: Empty target list in makefile dialog
  Problem:    For makefile driven projects, the list of available makefile
              targets was empty if the makefile was named anything other
              than "Makefile".
  Workaround: Rename the makefile to "Makefile" in the file system and the
              gpr file.

- K808-005: GPS: support for using '{' in macro expansion and ClearCase plugin
  Problem:    In the GPS shell language, the support for using {} to delimit
              a parameter in a string (for instance in 'echo "${1}.txt"') is
              broken, and this breaks some ClearCase Native interactions, such
              as comparison against the latest revision.
  Workaround: Use an external tool to perform the comparison.

- K804-028: GPS: Line highlighting not removed
  Problem:    Sometimes the line highlighting such as those showing build
              error messages are not removed from the editor, even if the
              corresponding message has been removed from the Locations view.
  Workaround: close and reopen the file editor.

- K728-017: GPS: Load desktop fails with editors outside of central area
  Problem:    If you move some editors in the project-independent part
              of a desktop (so that they are "hidden" when switching
              perspectives), they are incorrectly restored when the desktop
              is loaded the next time you launch GPS (and blank areas are
              seen instead).
  Workaround: Keep editors so that they are "preserved" when switching
              perspectives. This is the intent behind perspectives in any
              case.

- K727-003: GPS: CodePeer ranking and comments not updated
  Problem:    When the same message comes from several generic instantiations
              it looks like it reappear after change of its ranking and
              reloading of report. Actually, reappear message is another copy
              of the same message.
  Workaround: Change ranking of the message several times.

- K726-019: GPS: project view incorrectly refreshes extended projects
  Problem:    When using extending projects and changing scenario variables
              such that the extended project is modified (for instance its
              list of source directories), then the changes are not displayed
              properly in the project view, although they are properly taken
              into account by GPS.
  Workaround: close and reopen the project view.

- K726-004: GPS: cannot use dead key for apostrophe with some keyboard layouts
  Problems:   Under Windows, with some keyboard layouts such as international
              US, it is not possible to write the apostrophe character and the
              double quote character by pressing the corresponding dead key
              followed by space.
  Workaround: Use another keyboard layout.

- K721-007: GPS: ClearCase Native "Describe" actions not working
  Problem:    When using the ClearCase Native plugin, some basic actions such
              as "Describe" might not work.
  Workaround: In clearcase.xml, at line 16, in the definition of action
              "clearcase_describe", replace all occurrences of '\\' with '\'.

- K721-006: GPS: invalid project file generated when using the GPS dialog
  Problem:    When using the Project Properties dialog to create or modify a
              project, if line feed characters are introduced in text entries
              (through copy/pasting for instance), the project saved by GPS
              might not have a valid project syntax where this line feed is
              written.
  Workaround: Modify the project file manually to resolve the errors.

- K719-029: GPS: Refactoring not working if launched on entity with right name
  Problem:    When launching a Refactoring -> Rename <entity> operation, if the
              entity under the cursor already has the desired name, executing
              the refactoring will do nothing. This prevents for instance
              changing the casing of entities from an entity that has the right
              casing.
  Workaround: Find an instance that has the wrong casing and launch the
              renaming from that instance, or first change the name, then
              recompile, then re-change the name to the right casing.

- K711-021: GPS: Defining an alternate toolchain has no effect on gnatcheck
  Problem:    When using the dual compilation toolchain feature of GPS, then
              gnatcheck uses the compiler in 'compiler path' instead of the
              compiler in 'tools path'.
  Workaround: Manually update the paths before launching GPS for compilation
              or for tool use.

- K708-027: GPS: Debugger information on lines wrong after recompilation
  Problem:    When the Debugger preference "Show lines with code" is enabled,
              if you load one file editor, then end launch a debugging session,
              edit the file, recompile, and relaunch the debugging session, GPS
              will show 'dots' on the side of lines that were executable in the
              previous debugging session.
  Workaround: Disable the preference "Show lines with code", or switch to
              an editor for another file before launching the second debugging
              session.

- K708-026: GPS: some key shortcuts not working in modal dialogs
  Problem:    Key shortcuts involving "ctrl" or "alt", for instance "ctrl-v"
              to paste, do not work in modal dialogs.
  Workaround: Use equivalent key shortcuts (for instance "shift-insert" to
              paste) when they exist.

- K623-016: GB: GNATbench crash using Ada editor
  Problem:    Using Ada editor's code assist feature, sometimes lead to
              a crash.
  Workaround: Disable code assist tool using GNATbench Ada Tools preferences
              page. (see Window => Preferences => Ada => Tools).

- K607-047: Jumping to distant delimitor does not work
  Problem:    When using the menu Navigate->Goto Matching Delimiter, if the
              matching delimiter is too far away (more than 8192 characters),
              GPS does not jump to the position of the matching delimiter.
  Workaround: Go to the position manually.

- K518-016: Cannot create directories recursively
  Problem:    When creating a directory, for instance when creating a new
              project through the project Wizard, the IDE fails to create
              the directory if there are intermediate directories that need
              to be created.
  Workaround: Create the directory manually on the filesystem.

- K615-025: GB: Open Ada Declaration navigation selects wrong text
  Problem:    In some cases when opening the ada declaration (F3) the right ads
              file is opened at the right location but the selected text is not
              exactly the expected identifier.
  Workaround: Move the cursor manually or using the mouse to the exact column.
  
- K513-018 GB: GNATbench non-responsive after a build
  Problem:    When building Ada projects having a huge number of errors or
              warnings, the "Building Projects" task takes minutes to
              complete. Sometimes GNATbench becomes also non-responsive for
              minutes.
  Workaround: Disable quick fixes tool using GNATbench Ada Tools preferences
              page. (see Window => Preferences => Ada => Tools).

- K513-009 GPS: improved support for listing classes in Python outline
  Problem:    Classes were not always listed in the Outline for Python sources.
  Workaround: In plugin python_support.py, line 187, set the pattern to
    ^\s*class\s+([\w_][\w\d_]+)\s*(\([^\)]*\))?:

- K502-008 Spurious errors when using smart completion
  Problem:    When using extensively the smart completion through e.g. Dynamic
              smart completion in GPS, the completion may stop working and
              possibly leading to a crash.
  Workaround: Relaunch GPS or GNATbench.

- K425-003 GPS: some toolchains not properly loaded from project
  Problem:    If a toolchain is not defined in the 'toolchains.xml' file, then
              at startup GPS might not properly load the 'gnatmake' command.
  Workaround: Edit share/gps/plug-ins/toolchains.xml and add the toolchain
              there.

- K419-015 GB: GNATbench crash near startup
  Problem:    GNATbench 2.5.1 crashes depending on PATH environment variable.
              The crash occurs at GNATbench startup, or later when the first
              GNATbench function is accessed.
  Workaround: Remove all network locations from the PATH used when launching
              GNATbench. Simplify the PATH used when launching GNATbench.

- K418-017 GB: errors with comments ending with **
  Problem:    GNATbench may crash if source file contain comment ending with
              **.
  Workaround: Add some random character at the end of the comment.

- K418-012 GPS: creates broken library file for 'Analyze Root Project'
  Problem:    GPS creates broken library file for 'Analyze Root Project'
              action.
  Workaround: Use 'Analyze All' instead.

- K418-001 GPS: CodePeer's database can't be stored on separate drive
  Problem:    On Windows, CodePeer's output and database directories can be
              located on separate (from project) drive.
  Workaround: Use the same drive to store both project and CodePeer output and
              database directories.

- K414-002 GPS: CodePeer's SCIL messages are not removed on sequential runs
  Problem:    Error messages from CodePeer's SCIL generator are not removed on
              subsequential runs.
  Workaround: Manually remove 'CodePeer' category before next run.

- K413-033 GPS: Project properties editor slow to display
  Problem:    When your project has several thousand sources, the project
              properties editor might be slow to display.
  Workaround: Edit the plugin projects.xml and remove the lines for the
              "source_files" attribute. This will disable graphical editing
              of this attribute, but will make the editor faster.

- K405-023 GB: Coding Style editor stays "dirty" after save operation
  Problem:    After inserting values into text fields and saving the file
              via control-s, the page stays "dirty" as if the file has not
              been saved, unless the focus is moved away from the text field.
  Workaround: Move the focus away from the text field before saving.

- K405-009 GPS: Casing selected text may corrupt editor content
  Problem:    After selecting an area and using the Casing contextual
              menu, the text replaced in the source editor may be
              inserted starting at a wrong line.
  Workaround: Fix case in the area manually.

- K405-008 GPS: off-by-one error with empty rectangles
  Problem:    Select an empty rectangle (for instance from line 1, column 4
              to line 3, column 4), and select /Edit/Rectangles/Insert Text.
              The new text is inserted in column 3 instead of 4.
  Workaround: Select up to column 5 (a non-empty rectangle).

- K324-017 GB: convert to GNATbench project: finish button disabled
  Problem:    Sometimes when starting the "Convert to an Ada Project" wizard
              the finish button is disabled.
  Workaround: Touch the "Project to convert:" edit field.

- K315-047 Incorrect "auto-fix fo comparison with True is redundant"
  Problem:    When applying an auto-fix on redudant comparison with True,
              Codefix will fail to add the "not" in front of the expression
              if the comparison was made on a inequality.
  Workaround: Manually fix the code.

- K311-013 Exceptions with --## comments

  Problem:    Code containing comments starting with --## may issue an error
              message when loading or reloading the project.
  Workaround: Change the comments removing the # characters.

- K301-029 GPS: Handling of Coding Standard switches
  Problem:    When you use the menu /Tools/Coding Standard/Edit Rules,
              some rules are incorrectly generated by GPS (in particular,
              missing ':' between the switch and its parameter). Furthermore,
              an existing rule file is incorrectly loaded for switches that
              use ':' as a separator.
  Workaround: Edit the rule files manually.

- K228-039 GB: Coding Standard editor inserting additional colons
  Problem:    For switches taking values, GNATbench inserted a colon after
              the switch name when writing the rules file, but there was
              already a colon included.  As a result there were two colons
              between the switch name and the value.
  Workaround: Edit the rule files manually.

- K222-028 GB: Invoking metrics analysis does not show Problems view
  Problem:    When the metrics analysis cannot complete (e.g., due to syntax
              errors) the Metrics view is nonetheless given the focus, hiding
              the Problems view. This can leave the user under the impression
              that no problem has arisen because the Metrics view might still
              display (potentially obsolete) content.
  Workaround: Check the Problems view or Console view manually after invoking
              the metrics analysis.

- K131-009 GPS: Missing callers in Callgraph View
  Problem:    When a subprogram is called within a block or a loop with a
              label, the Call Graph in GPS will not show those calls.
  Workaround: Use "Find All References" in the contextual menu to find all
              locations of the calls, and click on them to find the caller.

- K108-001 GPS: Adding Makefile as a language results in errors
  Problem:    Edit the project properties to add Makefile as a language.
              GPS will raise an error when it parses the resulting project,
              complaining about the Body_Suffix attribute.
  Workaround: GPS no longer outputs a Body_Suffix to define the naming scheme.
              As a result, Makefiles are not automatically detected. Instead,
              you should add a naming exception for the makefile.

- JC15-033 Standard installation gpr files not found
  Problem:    On MILS and perhaps other Workbench environments such as 653,
              the gpr files installed automatically, such as "environment.gpr"
              and "apex.gpr", are not found with GNATbench and GPS. Setting
              GPR_PROJECT_PATH and ADA_PROJECT_PATH does not help.
  Workaround: Explicitly specify the path to the required gpr file within the
              referencing gpr file, rather than specifying the simple base
              file name.

- JC10-004 Errors when automatically fixing unused packages
  Problem:    When automatically removing an unused package through automatic
              code fixing, in certain situations, the chunk of removed code is
              larger than the package.
  Workaround: Manually delete the code.

- JC07-005 GB: project property GUI not showing scenario vars
  Problem:    When launched from GNATbench, the GPS property editor dialog does
              not show the scenario variables declared within the GNAT-defined
              project files located in <gnatpro installation>/lib/gnat, even
              though those gpr files are specified in with-clauses by the
              application project file.
  Workaround: Use the gpr textual editor to change the project file.

- JB10-036 Too many spaces for "out" formal parameters
  Problem:    When a routine has only explicit "out" formal parameters
              (no explicit "in" or "in out" mode) then using the
              "Align formal parameters" contextual menu will add too
              many spaces before the "out" mode.
  Workaround: Manually reformat the code.

- JB30-010 GB: Opening a file with extension ".rules" throws exception
  Problem:    When clicking on a file with the ".rules" extension, GNATbench
              attempts to open the file with the GNATCheck rules editor. This
              will raise an exception when the project containing the file is
              not a GNATbench project.
  Workaround: In this case the file is likely not a GNATCheck rules file (but
              could be a makefile file, for example) so use "Open With" to
              select a different editor to open the file.

- JB19-027 GB: Makefile target descriptions not shown in dialog
  Problem:    When applying the "Invoke Makefile Target" menu entry, the
              resulting dialog shows the target name in the description field.
  Workaround: Look in the makefile itself for the description.

- JB07-002 GPS: Key manager recording too restrictive
  Problem:    The key manager does not handle properly the case where the user
              defines a new mapping for ctrl-x when some other actions are
              mapped to a key using ctrl-x as a prefix (e.g. ctrl-x+b).
              Another limitation is that it refuses to define a binding
              for ctrl-x+b if some actions are using ctrl-x as prefix.
  Workaround: Edit .gps/keys.xml manually.

- J929-004 Keys '-' and '=' unuseable after using browsers
  Problem:    When using browsers (such as the Call Graph browser or the
              Entity browser), if you bring up the contextual menu on the
              browser, then the '-' and '=' keys can no longer be used in
              text editors.
  Workaround: Do not use the contextual menu on the browsers, or restart GPS
              afterwards. For intensive use of browsers, you can also open
              another instance of GPS on the same project for browser use.

- J914-003 Navigation errors when switching scenario variables
  Problem:    When switching back and forth scenario variables involving a
              change in the set of sources, the navigation may be confused
              and lead to files that are not in the current scenario.
  Workaround: Restart GPS / GNATbench and set the scenario on which navigation
              is expected.

- J902-019 Navigation without compilation doesn't work with UTF8
  Problem:    Navigation without compilation may not be available when there is
              UTF8 characters on the line.
  Workaround: Compile the file and then navigate.

- J429-026 GB: Project names cannot contain dashes
  Problem:    In Workbench, project names do not have to conform to the
              syntax of Ada identifiers, but the resulting project files
              are illegally named.  For example, dashes are allowed as
              project names but will cause project conversion to fail.
  Workaround: When creating projects in Workbench, use legal Ada identifiers.

- J329-016 GPS: ranking of some CodePeer messages cannot be changed
  Problem:    Ranking of 'check always fails' and 'subp never returns'
              messages cannot be changed by a manual message review.
              The ranking of these messages is always reset to 'high' when
              the codepeer analysis data is reloaded.
  Workaround: None.

- J302-007 No quick fixes for unreferenced type definitions
  Problem:    When an unreferenced type definition is detected by the compiler,
              no quick fix is offered to removed the type or add a pragma
              unreferenced.
  Workaround: Manually fix the code.

- I416-040 Source navigation does not work correctly with multi-unit files
  Problem:    External references in multi-unit source files are not fully
              supported.
  Workaround: Use gnatchop with multi-unit source files.

- H423-012 GB: "New Ada Source Dir" wizard always puts updated gpr file at root
  Problem:    When using the New Ada Source Dir wizard, the updated gpr file is
              unconditionally written to the project root instead of to the
              actual location.
  Workaround: Edit the gpr file manually.

- GB21-006 Profile completion errors with formal parameters
  Problem:    Auto completion with formal parameters of subprogram calls may
              not insert the correct formal parameters if there are already
              unordered parameters given.
  Workaround: Manually complete the code.

- F622-029 GPS: Completion prefix error when the list is too large
  Problem:    In GPS, when querying a smart completion, if the list is too
              large, the common prefix used to complete the current identifier
              may be wrong.
  Workaround: Manually complete the code.

- KB10-049 GPS: breakpoint editor list not opening source file
  Problem:    In GPS, double-click on any breakpoint in the list doesn't open
              the corresponding source editor at the right location.
  Workaround: Click on the 'View' button to navigate.
