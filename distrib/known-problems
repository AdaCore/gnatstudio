Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.2.0

- G919-023: Enumeration fields not listed in entity browser
  Problem:    When displaying a record type in the entity browser,
              fields of enumeration types are not listed.
  Workaround: No known workaround.

- G914-001 "pango" warnings in the Messages window
  Problem:    Error messages beginning with:
              "sys:1: PangoWarning: pango_layout_set_markup_with_accel"
              might appear in the Messages window, when displaying
              tooltips for an entity, when the documentation associated
              with this entity contains characters '<' or '>'.
  Workaround: This message can be safely ignored.

- G913-009 Unwanted scrolling when pasting with middle mouse button
  Problem:    Under UNIX systems, when pasting text from the X11
              clipboard using the middle mouse button, GPS scrolls the editor
              to the position of the cursor or selection, instead of
              scrolling to the point of insertion.
  Workaround: Place the cursor on screen before inserting.

- G910-002 Wrong links in python API documentation
  Problem:    In the python API documentation generated through the
              /Help/Python extensions menus, links corresponding to classes
              point to the Global routines page.
  Workaround: Access the class page using the links in the left menu.

- G905-023 Source_Files attribute not working for languages other than Ada
  Problem:    If your project file specifies languages other than Ada, and
              uses the attributes Source_Files or Source_List_File, then
              GPS systematically displays a warning in the console (which
              can safely be ignored), and fails to load some of the source
              files
  Workaround: none, this is a memory corruption. Try and remove the above
              attributes from your project, and let GPS compute the list of
              source files automatically.

- G829-018 Remote debugging problems
  Problem:    With some remote servers, and depending on the protocol used,
              remote debugging is very slow and behaves incorrectly. The main
              symptoms are: the breakpoints are not reported to the editor,
              the program pointer is not visible in the editor.
  Workaround: Try other protocols, like ssh wich is less subject to the error.

- G809-010 Read-only configuration files are not handled by GPS
  Problem:    If files under .gps are read-only, then GPS will not detect it
              and may crash.
  Workaround: Make sure the .gps directory and its contents are writable.

- G730-004 Wrong syntax highlighting after pasting text
  Problem:    After using Ctrl-C to copy text or Ctrl-X to cut text, the pasted
              text might keep the syntax highligting corresponding to the
              original text, even if the highlighting is no longer pertinent in
              the new context.
  Workaround: Use Ctrl+Insert to copy text and Shift+Delete to cut text.
              Alternatively, use the Key Manager to assign Ctrl-C and Ctrl-X
              to the General actions "Copy to Clipboard" and "Cut to Clipboard"

- G723-003 Percent sign lost in revision history
  Problem:    When commiting a file, percent signs that were par tof the
              revision log are sent to the underlying version control system.
              Likewise, revision logs already entered in the version control
              system that contain percent sign will not be rendered properly
              in GPS.
  Workaround: Use two percent signs in a row. For example, write "%%a" instead
              of "%a".

- G717-004 Remote connection using ssh on Windows no longer handles passwords
  Problem:    Under Windows, when GPS tries to connect to a remote machine
              using ssh, and ssh asks for a username or a password, then GPS
              won't receive this request, thus blocking the connection.
  Workaround: In share/gps/plug-ins/protocols.xml, set the use_pipes attribute
              of the start_command tag to "false" for the ssh
              remote_connection_config.

- G714-002 Problems with huge clipboard entries
  Problem:    If you copy a huge piece of code to the clipboard and then exit
              GPS, the next time GPS is launched it could take a very long time
              to start up.
  Workaround: Remove the clipboards.xml file that you can find in the
              $HOME/.gps directory before restarting GPS.

- G628-004 Generated AUnit test cases are missing a use clause
  Problem:    When GPS generates a new AUnit test case for AUnit 2.x, a use
              clause for the AUnit unit is missing.
  Workaround: Add a use AUnit clause in the generated file.

- G628-002 Refactoring and renaming variables in not up-to-date files
  Problem:    When using the "rename variable" refactoring, GPS would corrupt
              the file if its cross-reference information is not up-to-date and
              the line on which the entity occurs has already been modified
  Workaround: Make sure to save all files before starting a refactoring. GPS
              will then display a dialog warning you that some files might not
              be up-to-date, and in this case you should cancel the refactoring.

- G625-004 GPS.execute_action not synchronous, and hiding its output
  Problem:    If your script uses GPS.execute_action, it will not properly
              execute external commands synchronously (meaning the call will
              return before the external process has finished executing). In
              addition, the output of the external process is never displayed
  Workaround: use the GPS.Process class.

- G611-028 Files status overriden
  Problem:    When opening a file the status in the VCS Explorer and
              the VCS Activities is set to locally modified. This is
              because a bad interaction between the explorers and the
              cached statuses.
  Workaround: Use the Query Status action to recover the proper status

- G526-001 Incorrect display of block highlighting
  Problem:    In some very long source files, the block highlighing line may
              be drawn incorrectly on very large areas containing no block
              information.
  Workaround: The block highlighting line can be safely ignored.

- G517-001 Makefile.py plug-in: various fixes
  Problem:    Various minor issues were fixed in the Makefile plugin.
              When the project loaded from the command line defines the
              "make" package, no warning should be displayed in the console.
              When a scenario variable is changed, and the project then
              defines a new Makefile to use, this new value is not taken into
              account and the old Makefile is still used. Entries containing
              full path names are also not displayed correctly
  Workaround: This warning can be safely ignored

- G502-009 <on-failure> not executed with empty <external> command
  Problem:    If you create an XML file with an action that executes an
              empty <external> command, an internal error is reported, but
              GPS doesn't execute the following <on-failure> node.
  Workaround: Make sure the command to execute cannot be empty.

- G503-011 Bad indentation of single line C constructs
  Problem:    GPS does not properly unindent single line construct (statements
              with no {}), e.g:
              if (cond1)
                if (cond2)
                  do_x ();
              do_y ();   <- this line was incorrectly indented
  Workaround: Fix indentation manually, or use {} around statements.

- G427-022 Removing files from an activity makes GPS unstable
  Problem:    When removing files from an activity there is a memory
              corruption. This can make GPS unstable and it may exit.
  Workaround: Create a new activity instead of removing files from the
              current activity. Note that even if GPS crashes the
              activity information is properly saved, so when GPS is
              restarted no data are lost.

- G420-033 Edited project with custom language has unexpected changes
  Problem:    If you project uses one of the predefined languages other
              than Ada and C (e.g. "Project File"), then opening the project
              properties editor, and clicking on OK results in a change in
              the Naming package of your project. The resulting project
              results in a warning when loaded by GNAT
  Workaround: Define a dummy extension for the naming scheme of these extra
              languages, so that none of the extensions is empty

- G417-011 Removing a key shortcuts leaves the key unusuable
  Problem:    If you have used the /Edit/Key Shortcuts dialog to bind a key
              to some action, and later on used the same dialog to remove that
              shortcut, then the key itself is no longer usable in this GPS
              session (for instance if it was bound to backspace, then you
              won't be able to use it later on)
  Workaround: Exit GPS and restart.

- G413-018 Python/Shell commands related to EditorView not working
  Problem:    Python/Shell commands related to the class EditorView, for
              example EditorView.goto or EditorView.cursor, might not return
              the right result when working on editors that contain folded
              blocks or "blank" lines (such as editors involved in Visual
              Comparisons).
  Workaround: Unfold all blocks and remove comparisons when using such commands
              on editors.

- G412-023 Big items truncated in the debugger Data window
  Problem:    The content of some items in the debugger Data window migth be
              truncated.
              The maximum width and height of an item displayed in the Data
              window is now customizable through the Browsers section of the
              Preferences dialog. Upon a preference change, all items will be
              redrawn. This allows in particular to fully display big items.
  Workaround: In some cases you can display the truncated part in an item of
              its own instead of having one big items in which everyting is
              displayed directly.

- G323-017 Incomplete list of child types in entities browser
  Problem:    If you click on the "down" arrow for a tagged type displayed
              in the entities browser, it shows the list of types that
              extend that type. However, it only shows those types for the
              files for which xref information has already been loaded in
              memory.
  Workaround: First select the menu /Build/Load xref info in memory", and
              only then click on the down arrow.

- G323-009 Documentation gives wrong return type
  Problem:    When the parameter initialization of a function contains the
              reserved words "null" or "not", these words will go into the
              returned type of the documentation.
  Workaround  Ignore such documentation.

- G316-005 Auto-casing is confused by string quotes characters constants.
  Problem:    When a string quote character is used ('"' in Ada or C), and
              a string constant is following this character constant, then GPS
              will apply the casing inside the string.
  Workaround: Deactivate the auto-casing, or use a newline character after
              the string quote character.

- G306-007 Multiple dialogs appearing on key shortcuts.
  Problem:    Some dialogs, such as the "Continue Search?" dialog or the
              "Open File" dialog, might appear multiple times when launched
              through key shortcuts.
  Workaround: The extraneous dialogs can be closed safely.

- G225-003 Activity indicator show "busy" state when using some plug-ins
  Problem:    When using some plug-ins which launch a process in the
              background, such as the spell checking "ispell" plug-in,
              the GPS activity indicator in the top-right corner show
              a busy state while the process is running.
  Workaround: Refer to the Task Manager to determine activity status of GPS.

- G119-006 Extra line reformatted with the "align" plug-in
  Problem:    When the low bound of the selection is located before the
              first character of a line, this line gets reformatted although
              this is not very intuitive.
  Workaround: Be sure the cursor in on the last line you want to reformat.
              You can move the cursor with the keyboard arrows (while pressing
              SHIFT to keep the current selection) to make sure it is not
              actually located on the following line.

- G118-012 Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V do not work with Clipboard view
  Problem:    Although Ctrl-C and Ctrl-C keys perform Copy and Paste 
              operations, these operations are not connected to the Clipboard
              View.
  Workaround: Use Ctrl+Insert to copy text and Shift+Insert to paste text.
              Alternatively, use the Key Manager to assign Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V
              to the General actions "Copy to Clipboard" and "Paste from
              Clipboard".

- FB30-007 Completion doesn't work on symbol operators
  Problem:    When completing symbol operators, for example A."+" (|, the
              completion engine doesn't provide any completion.
  Workaround: Manually complete the code.

- FA17-011 Refactoring C sources
  Problem:    When renaming a C entity, it happens that some references are
              not properly renamed, even after selecting "Recompute C/C++
              xref" as documented.
  Workaround: Select the menu "Recompute C/C++ xref", exit GPS and restart
              it. It will properly reload its xref database.

- F223-015 Duplicate links in entity browser
  Problem:    In the entity browser, it might happen that clicking several
              times on an hyper link will create duplicate links between
              entities.
  Workaround: This is purely graphical, and does not impact the semantic.

- F907-001 Code fixing doesn't work with double quotes
  Problem:    When strings involves double quotes, the autofix process is
              sometimes unable to locate precisely where the fix has to be
              done.
  Workaround: Manually fix the error.

- EB07-020 Duplicate references in the callgraph browser
  Problem:    If you use several times the contextual menu
              "Browsers/is called by" on the same entity, GPS would duplicate
              the locations of the call within the box representing the entity
  Workaround: This is purely graphical, you can close the box and reopen to
              clean it up if you need.

- DB25-010 Symbols not loaded when initializing cross debugger
  Problem:    When using GPS in a remote debugging configuration (ie, with the
              debugger running on a machine other than the executable being
              debugged) other than VxWorks environments, the underlying
              debugger does not load the debug symbols.
  Workaround: Load the symbols manually using the appropriate "file", "target"
              and "load" commands in the debugger console.
