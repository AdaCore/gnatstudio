Known Problems fixed in GPS 3.1.0

- E525-012 Pasting in the consoles
  Problem:    When using the system-defined method for pasting the clipboard
              (ie ctrl-v under Windows, or middle-button press under Unix) in
              the GPS consoles, the text is always appended at the end of the
              line.
  Workaround: Use the menu Edit->Paste or its associated key binding.

- E308-016 Cannot initialize debugger under Tru64
  Problem:    In some cases, when initializing the debugger under Tru64,
              an error message is displayed in the debugger console such as:
              /dev/ptyrd: No such file or directory.
              /proc/380269: No such file or directory.
  Workaround: Disable the "Execution Window" preference in the Debugger section
