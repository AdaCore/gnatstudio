- JC10-004 Errors when automatically fixing unused packages
  Problem:    When automatically removing an unused package through automatic
              code fixing, in certain situations, the chunk of removed code is
              larger than the package.
  Workaround: Manually delete the code.

- JB10-036 Too many spaces for "out" formal parameters
  Problem:    When a routine has only explicit "out" formal parameters
              (no explicit "in" or "in out" mode) then using the
              "Align formal parameters" contextual menu will add too
              many spaces before the "out" mode.
  Workaround: Manually reformat the code.

- JB30-010  GB: Opening a file with extension ".rules" throws exception
  Problem:    When clicking on a file with the ".rules" extension, GNATbench
              attempts to open the file with the GNATCheck rules editor. This
              will raise an exception when the project containing the file is
              not a GNATbench project.
  Workaround: In this case the file is likely not a GNATCheck rules file (but
              could be a makefile file, for example) so use "Open With" to
              select a different editor to open the file.

- JB19-027 GB: Makefile target descriptions not shown in dialog
  Problem:    When applying the "Invoke Makefile Target" menu entry, the
              resulting dialog shows the target name in the description field.
  Workaround: Look in the makefile itself for the description.

- JB07-002 GPS: Key manager recording was too restrictive
  Problem:    The key manager was not properly handling the case where we
              define a new mapping for ctrl-x when some other actions are
              mapped to key using ctrl-x as prefix (e.g. ctrl-x+b).
              Another limitation was that it refuses to define a binding
              for ctrl-x+b if some actions were using ctrl-x as prefix.
  Workaround: Edit .gps/keys.xml manually.

- J914-003 Navigation errors when switching scenario variables
  Problem:    When switching back and forth scenario variables involving a
              change in the set of sources, the navigation may be confused
              and lead to files that are not in the current scenario.
  Workaround: Restart GPS / GNATbench and set the scenario on which navigation
              is expected.

- J902-019 Navigation without compilation doesn't work with UTF8
  Problem:    Navigation without compilation may not be available when there is
              UTF8 characters on the line.
  Workaround: Compile the file and then navigate.

- J302-007 No quick fixes for unreferenced type definitions
  Problem:    When an unreferenced type definition is detected by the compiler,
              no quick fix is offered to removed the type or add a pragma
              unreferenced.
  Workaround: Manually fix the code.

- GB21-006 Profile completion errors with formal parameters
  Problem:    Auto completion with formal parameters of subprogram calls may
              not insert the correct formal parameters if there are already
              unordered parameters given.
  Workaround: Manually complete the code.

- F622-029 GPS: Completion prefix error when the list is too large
  Problem:    In GPS, when querying a smart completion, if the list is too
              large, the common prefix used to complete the current identifier
              may be wrong.
  Workaround: Manually complete the code.
