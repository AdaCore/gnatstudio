Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.3.0

- Infinite loop in search dialog
  Problem:    In some cases, it might happen that looking for a constant string
              results in an infinite loop in GPS.
  Workaround: Click the Regexp button in the search dialog before starting the
              search

- C326-004 Duplicate entries in dialog File->Open From Project
  Problem:    When using extending projects, duplicate source files might be
              displayed in this dialog (once for the original project and once
              for the extending project)
  Workaround: Click on any of the instance, they all point to the same file
