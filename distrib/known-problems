Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.3.0

- C425-019 Handling of projects with no supported language
  Problem:    If you create a project with no supported language (either through
              the project properties editor or manually by setting the
              Languages attribute to the empty list), GPS will show "Ada" as
              supported the next time the project properties editor is open
  Workaround: Edit such projects by hand

- C425-020 Selection in greyed out fields in the project properties editor
  Problem:    If Ada is not a supported language for your project, the combo
              boxes for the compiler and gnatls can still be selected by
              clicking on the arrow
  Workaround: Avoid clicking on the arrow, although no arm will result if you
              do. The new setting is simply ignored when the project is saved

- C418-010 Messages window not saved in the desktop
  Problem:    When the desktop is saved, the location of the messages window
              is not saved.
  Workaround: It is possible to manually edit the file $HOME/.gps/desktop, but
              it is simpler to move the messages window back to the location
              where you want it on startup

- C418-010 Incorrect desktop loading for location window
  Problem:    If the location window is put in the left dock, and the desktop
              is saved, then GPS won't be able to restore the desktop on startup
              and will crash
  Workaround: Edit the file $HOME/.gps/desktop by hand to remove the location
              window reference

- gnat stub started with wrong project
  Problem:    When the menu Edit->Generate Body is selected, gnat stub fails
              executing because it cannot found the project
  Workaround: run gnat stub directly in a shell window

- C312-002 Code correction error
  Problem:    When using automatic code correction, sometimes the correction is
              wrong.
  Workaround: Save the files in "UNIX" mode.

- Infinite loop in search dialog
  Problem:    In some cases, it might happen that looking for a constant string
              results in an infinite loop in GPS.
  Workaround: Click the Regexp button in the search dialog before starting the
              search

- Incorrect refresh of the project explorer when the project changes
  Problem:    If you change the project or the scenario variables, the project
              explorer's contents is refreshed, and all directories seem to
              contain files (there is a [+] on the left).
  Workaround: None needed, when you click on the +, it simply disappears.

- C326-004 Duplicate entries in dialog File->Open From Project
  Problem:    When using extending projects, duplicate source files might be
              displayed in this dialog (once for the original project and once
              for the extending project)
  Workaround: Click on any of the instance, they all point to the same file
