Known Problems fixed in GPS 6.0.0 / GNATbench 2.8.0

- LA24-013: Bad indentation of some lines in function calls
  Problem:    When indenting a single line in the middle of a complex function
              call containing several parentheses, the indentation engine may
              get confused and badly indent the line.
  Workaround: Select the whole function call and then indent it as a whole.

- LA23-019: Bad indentation of access procedure type in generic declaration
  Problem:    When indenting code of the form:
              generic
                 type T is access procedure;
              The indentation engine gets confused and wrongly indents the
              following statements.
  Workaround: Fix the indentation manually.

- LA12-034: GPS: wrong menu for target with custom name in extending project
  Problem:    When using an extending project which defines an executable name
              for a main which is defined in the extended project, GPS does not
              display the custom name in the "Run" menu, and the corresponding
              target cannot be launched through the menu or the toolbar button.
  Workaround: Use the Build->Run->Custom... menu
