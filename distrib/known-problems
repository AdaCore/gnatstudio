- JA07-011 GPS: Location view and floating editors
  Problem:    When clicking in a location, the corresponding floating editor
              is not raised (no problem when the editor is not floating)

              click on the window to raise it.

- J302-007 No quick fixes for unreferenced type definitions
  Problem:    When an unreferenced type definition is detected by the compiler,
              no quick fix is offered to removed the type or add a pragma
              unreferenced.
  Workaround: Manually fix the code.

- GB21-006 Profile completion errors with formal parameters
  Problem:    Auto completion with formal parameters of subprogram calls may
              not insert the correct formal parameters if there are already
              unordered parameters given.
  Workaround: Manually complete the code.

- F622-029 GPS: Completion prefix error when the list is too large
  Problem:    In GPS, when querying a smart completion, if the list is too 
              large, the common prefix used to complete the current identifier
              may be wrong.
  Workaround: Manually complete the code.
