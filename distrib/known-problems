Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.5.0

- IA21-005 Key Shortcuts editor dialog is now clearer
  Problem:    When you press Grab in the key shortcuts editor, you are left
              with a busy cursor with no obvious indication that GPS is
              waiting for input.
  Workaround: Press the new shortcut you wish to assign.

- I612-002 Name Parameters and dotted notation
  Problem:    When a primitive operation is called using the new Ada05
              dotted notation, the refactoring Name Parameter repeats the
              first parameter name (even though it is in fact given
              before the ".").
  Workaround: Change to standard call, do the renaming, and then back to
              the dotted notation.

- F430-001 Search whole word give wrong result when text is selected
  Problem:    When a portion of word is selected, e.g. Something is selected
              as a part of the word A_Something, doing a search whole word may
              not be completely accurate for that selection, and will e.g.
              return the selected match if looked for the pattern equals the
              selection
  Workaround: Do the search without selecting the text.
