Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.2.0

- G316-005 Auto-casing is confused by string quotes characters constants.
  Problem:    When a string quote character is used ('"' in Ada or C), and
              a string constant is following this character constant, then GPS
              will apply the casing inside the string.
  Workaround: Deactivate the auto-casing, or use a newline character after
              the string quote character.

- G306-007 Multiple dialogs appearing on key shortcuts.
  Problem:    Some dialogs, such as the "Continue Search?" dialog or the
              "Open File" dialog, might appear multiple times when launched
              through key shortcuts.
  Workaround: The extraneous dialogs can be closed safely.

- G225-003 Activity indicator show "busy" state when using some plugins
  Problem:    When using some plugins which launch a process in the background,
              such as the spell checking "ispell" plugin, the GPS activity
              indicator in the top-right corner show a busy state while the
              process is running.
  Workaround: Refer to the Task Manager to determine activity status of GPS.

- DB25-010 Symbols not loaded when initializing cross debugger
  Problem:    When using GPS in a remote debugging configuration (ie, with the
              debugger running on a machine other than the executable being
              debugged) other than VxWorks environments, the underlying
              debugger does not load the debug symbols.
  Workaround: Load the symbols manually using the appropriate "file", "target"
              and "load" commands in the debugger console.
