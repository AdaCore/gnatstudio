Known Problems fixed in GPS 5.2.0 / GNATbench 2.7.0

- L112-001: GPS: Unable to open CodePeer report when no race conditions
  Problem:    GPS is unable to open CodePeer report when analysis is done
              without race condition analysis.
  Workaround: Enable race condition analysis by CodePeer.


- KC20-025: GPS: Removing a server makes some other servers unuseable
  Problem:    After removing a server from your server list, the other servers
              using the same shell or remote access tool become unuseable.
  Workaround: Remove the server manually from the .gps/remote.xml file.

- KC12-009: Find All References missing refs with extending projects
  Problem:    When searching for all references from a file in an extending
              project, GPS fails to report the references that are in files
              that are in other non-extending projects.
  Workaround: Manually load all Xref information via the /Build menu.

- K930-020: Recursive project source dirs and Windows host
  Problem:    When GPS is running on a Windows host, but driving a Unix
              build server, and the user edits the project to use recursive
              subdirectories, the syntax generated in the project file is
              Windows specific and rejected by the build server.
  Workaround: Edit the project manually to replace "\**" with "/**".

- K926-014: GB: GNATbench freezes when viewing/editing Ada files
  Problem:    Randomly when using the GNATbench Ada editor for code edition
              or program debug, GNATbench freezes. The only solution to get
              rid of the lock is to kill GNATbench, and launch it back.
  Workaround: - Run menu Window => Preferences
              - Open Ada => Editor preferences page
              - Disable the 3 following features
                1- Tooltips should be displayed automatically.
                2- Enable Code Assist.
                3- Enable Code Assist auto activation.

- K804-029: GPS: cannot bind Tab key to menus and use it to navigate
  Problem:    When assigning the Tab key to a menu, for instance
              /Edit/Format Selection, it is not possible to use the Tab key
              to navigate in the non-modal dialogs such as the Search dialog.
  Workaround: Use another key shortcut, or bind the Tab key to the
              corresponding action if it exists (for instance the action
              "Format Selection" in the "Editor" section in the Key Shortcuts
              view).

- K325-019: GPS: autofix for lines containing only spaces
  Problem:    The autofix for blanks at end of line removes the whole line if
              the line is composed only by spaces.
  Workaround: Do not use autofix on such lines or replace manually the removed
              line by an empty line.
