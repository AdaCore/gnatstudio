Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.4.1

- Output of external commands not visible
  Problem:    If you specify an external command to be executed through a
              customization file, the command and its output were not visible in              the Messages window
  Workaround: Do an explicit call to "echo" if your custom action
                                                                                
- CC11-011 Key bindings not working when num-lock or caps-lock is turned on.
  Problem:    When using user-configured key shortcuts, the shortcuts do not
              work when caps-lock or num-lock is enabled on the keyboard.
  Workaround: Switch off caps-lock and num-lock when using GPS.

- CC02-007 Duplicate of attribute declarations in generated project files
  Problem:    GPS will insert duplicate declarations for the attributes if
              you edit the switches through the Project Properties editor.
  Workaround: In the ada_support.xml and c_support.xml files installed with
              GPS, replace 'index="Ada"' with 'index="ada"'

- CC01-003 Error when saving project
  Problem:    Saving a project through Project->Save All might result in an
              internal error which blocks GPS, and does not save the project.
  Workaround: Save the modified projects one by one through the contextual
              menu in the project explorer

- CB30-003 GPS hangs when compiling file with 'new abstract' syntax error
  Problem:    When compiling a file with constrcuts such as
              type A is new abstract B with private;
              GPS hangs.
  Workaround: Fix the code by swapping 'abstract' and 'new'

- CB19-011 Keywords always case sensitive in custom languages
  Problem:    When defining a custom language in an xml file, the keywords
              regexp will always be case sensitive.
  Workaround: Modify the regexp so that more than one casing is taken into
              account.

- CB18-005 Bad saving of the desktop when quitting from the welcome dialog
  Problem:    When quitting from the welcome dialog directly, the desktop
              file (.gps/desktop) is saved with incorrect values, leading
              to strange behavior such as the main window not shown on the
              screen, or the project view not restored.
  Workaround: Do not use the quit button, or edit manually the file
              .gps/desktop to fix the incorrect values.
              If the main window is not shown under Windows, you can
              right click on the program icon in the task bar and maximize
              the window.

- CB18-006 Duplicate entries in Help module
  Problem:    The GNAT documentation appears twice in the Help menu.
  Workaround: Edit the small gps wrapper, and remove the lines containing
              GPS_DOC_PATH. On Windows, simply unset this environment
              variable

- CB17-001 Bad indentation of separate functions
  Problem:    When indenting functions declaraed as separate whose
              specification is longer than one line, the indentation will
              be incorrect.
  Workaround: Put the specification is one line.

- CB14-007 Open file from project fails with extending projects
  Problem:    If your setup includes extending projects, it is possible that
              the menu File->Open From Path will open the file from the
              parent project instead of the extending project.
  Workaround: Use the File->Open dialog instead.

Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.4.0

- CA27-013 Wrong gnatmake command used when building current file
  Problem:    When using Build->Make->Current File, the command 'gnatmake'
              is always used, even if another command has been specified
              in the project.
  Workaround: Add the file in the list of main sources and use the
              corresponding Build->Make entry.

- Project file not saved automatically when building
  Problem:    When using the preference General->Auto save, the project file
              is not saved when calling external tools (e.g. builder).
  Workaround: Save the project file explicitely.

- CA27-001 Bad indentation of 'exit when' inside a case statement
  Problem:    The source editor will wrongly indent code containing
              'exit when' construct inside a case statement.
  Workaround: Indent the line by hand.

- CA21-003 GPS unstable when displaying xrefs or tooltips after project switch
  Problem:    After changing projects within GPS using the Project->Open menu
              or the Project->Recent menu, GPS might become unstable when using
              xrefs or displaying tooltips.
  Workaround: Quit GPS and launch a new session with the other project.

- CA15-004 GPS crash when doing xref in Ada unit containing separate
  Problem:    A memory corruption occurs when doing cross-references on a
              unit which has separates. This can result in a GPS crash.
  Workaround: Use child units instead of separates.

- CA08-005 Searching file names in explorer fails for extended projects
  Problem:    If you are looking for a specific file name in the project
              explorer, the files in extended project will not be found by
              GPS.
  Workaround: None known

- CA02-013 Unexpected crashes under Windows.
  Problem:    GPS sometimes crashes unexpectedly under windows. This is most
              likely to happen after compiling files several times.
  Workaround: Regularly quitting and relaunching GPS will avoid this issue.

- Cross-reference fail with Ada units overriden in extending projects (C825-005)
  Problem:    If you have a unit overriden in an extending project with a
              different file name, cross-references will fail for all files
              that reference that Unit
  Workaround: If possible, remove overriden units in extended projects. If not
              possible, rename them so as to use the same name as in extending
              projects

- Goto Other File fails for C files
  Problem:    If you are editing a C file and select "Goto file spec/body" in
              the contextual menu, a .ads file is generated, ie an Ada file
  Workaround: This works fine if there is indeed a <file>.h in the project.
              Otherwise, just kill the newly created editor

- C917-001 Search/Replace gives wrong results when blocks are folded.
  Problem:    When blocks are folded in the editor, searching for a string or
              for multiple occurrences of a string gives wrong results.
  Workaround: Unfold all blocks before searching.
              (Note that it is not recommended to use block folding in version
               1.3.0)

- C916-010 Internal error when generating new testsuite
  Problem:    When you use the Edit->Unit Testing menu and attempt to add
              a new testsuite, GPS crashes.
  Workaround: Create the test suite by hand.

- C912-003 Removing dependency for a project other than the root project fails
  Problem:    If you remove a dependency between two projects when none of them
              is the root project, GPS will fail.
  Workaround: Edit the project files manually, and reload the project

- C911-008 Hang when highlighting empty string
  Problem:    In some very specific cases, GPS may hang or badly highlight
              source code when e.g. closing an empty string.
  Workaround: None known

- C901-010 Auto-save not always performed before a build
  Problem:    When using some combinations of undo/redo before doing a build,
              it can happen that the file is not automatically saved when
              building.
  Workaround: Save the file manually.

- C822-014 Cross-references fail on Ada files with file-specific naming schemes
  Problem:    If you are using Ada files with an irregular naming scheme (i.e.
              you don't specify a general way to compute the name of the
              file, but have to specify the mapping unit<->file for each file),
              then cross-references for specs without bodies and separate units
              fail
  Workaround: Use gnatchop to rename the files

- C812-004 Searching doesn't take into account a selection in the File View
  Problem:    When a file is selected in the File View, using the search dialog
              will not look into this file but in open editors.
  Workaround: Use the search mode "Files..." or manually open the file before
              searching.

- C805-014 %pp in custom menus doesn't work from source editors
  Problem:    If your custom menu launches a command with the %pp parameter,
              the latter will not be substitued when launched while a source
              editor has the focus.
  Workaround: Select the file in the project view, and activate the menu while
              the latter has the focus

- C508-001 Focus and dialog issues
  Problem:    If you start editing a file, and then click on the [x] button
              in the title bar, this opens a confirmation dialog. Selecting
              Cancel in the dialog doesn't give the focus back to the editor
  Workaround: Click in the editor to gain the focus back

- C502-014 Code fixing does not work on lines containing TABs.
  Problem:    When there are errors in a line containing tabulations, the
              automatic code fixing does not provide an icon to fix errors.
  Workaround: Fix the errors manually.

- Internal error when looking for the body of Unchecked_Deallocation
  Problem:    If you right click on the work Unchecked_Deallocation in Ada
              mode, and ask for its body, an internal error is reported
  Workaround: Unchecked_Deallocation has no body, no need to look for it

- Messages window not raised when initial project has errors
  Problem:    If you load from the command line a project file that contains
              errors, the Messages window is not raised to make them visible.
  Workaround: Switch to the Messages window manually

- Saving project with languages other than Ada doesn't always generate Makefile
  Problem:    If a project is importing another project that has languages
              other than Ada, no Makefile is generated for the project.
  Workaround: run gpr2make by hand

- A project with no source files couldn't be open in the Project View
  Problem:    If source directories were defined for the project, but no
              source file was found in them, the source directories couldn't
              be accessed through the explorer.
  Workaround: Use the Files View to access the directory
