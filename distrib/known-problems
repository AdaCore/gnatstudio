Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.2.0

- G413-018 Python/Shell commands related to EditorView not working
  Problem:    Python/Shell commands related to the class EditorView, for
              example EditorView.goto or EditorView.cursor, might not return
              the right result when working on editors that contain folded
              blocks or "blank" lines (such as editors involved in Visual
              Comparisons).
  Workaround: Unfold all blocks and remove comparisons when using such commands
              on editors.

- G316-005 Auto-casing is confused by string quotes characters constants.
  Problem:    When a string quote character is used ('"' in Ada or C), and
              a string constant is following this character constant, then GPS
              will apply the casing inside the string.
  Workaround: Deactivate the auto-casing, or use a newline character after
              the string quote character.

- G306-007 Multiple dialogs appearing on key shortcuts.
  Problem:    Some dialogs, such as the "Continue Search?" dialog or the
              "Open File" dialog, might appear multiple times when launched
              through key shortcuts.
  Workaround: The extraneous dialogs can be closed safely.

- G225-003 Activity indicator show "busy" state when using some plugins
  Problem:    When using some plugins which launch a process in the background,
              such as the spell checking "ispell" plugin, the GPS activity
              indicator in the top-right corner show a busy state while the
              process is running.
  Workaround: Refer to the Task Manager to determine activity status of GPS.

- G119-006 Extra line reformatted with the "align" plugin
  Problem:    When the low bound of the selection is located before the
              first character of a line, this line gets reformatted although
              this is not very intuitive.
  Workaround: Be sure the cursor in on the last line you want to reformat.
              You can move the cursor with the keyboard arrows (while pressing
              SHIFT to keep the current selection) to make sure it is not
              actually located on the following line.

- F907-001 Code fixing doesn't work with double quotes
  Problem:    When strings involves double quotes, the autofix process is
              sometimes unable to locate precisely where the fix has to be
              done.
  Workaround: Manually fix the error. 

- DB25-010 Symbols not loaded when initializing cross debugger
  Problem:    When using GPS in a remote debugging configuration (ie, with the
              debugger running on a machine other than the executable being
              debugged) other than VxWorks environments, the underlying
              debugger does not load the debug symbols.
  Workaround: Load the symbols manually using the appropriate "file", "target"
              and "load" commands in the debugger console.
