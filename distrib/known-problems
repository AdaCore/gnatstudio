Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.2.0

- GA24-020: Wrong cursor location after using Smart Completion
  Problem:    When using Smart Completion, when removing characters after
              having performed a first completion, the cursor might jump at the
              beginning of the current entity.
  Workaround: Move the cursor back to the right location.

- GA12-014: C++ cross-references and library project files
  Problem:    If you are using a library project file, GPS will not find the
              cross-reference information generated by the Compute C++ Xref
              Info menu, and as a result no contextual menu for navigation
              will be visible.
  Workaround: Create a link from the object directory to the library directory
              (or copy the files manually after selecting the menu to compute
              the info).
