Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.2.0

- Crash when opening multiple new files. (C130-023)
  Problem:    When when opening new files using the menu File->New or the
              toolbar icon, opening multiple new files when the line numbers
              are displayed causes GPS to crash.
  Workaround: In the preferences dialog, disable the "Display line numbers"
              preference in the Editor section.

- Bad handling of item icon when saving new file
  Problem:    After saving an untitled file, the icon corresponding to the
              editor still shows the "modified" icon.
  Workaround: Save the file twice.

- Extended project nodes duplicated in explorer when recomputing view
  Problem:    If your project hierarchy includes extended project, and you
              select the menu Project->Recompute View, the extended project
              nodes are duplicated, and the exec directories disappear
  Workaround: Reload the project through Project->Recent instead

- BC04-009 Annoying scrolling when switching tabs.
  Problem:    When switching from an editor to another, the editors scroll
              back to the place where their cursor is set, not to the point
              that was viewed the most recently.
  Workaround: Set the cursor within the viewed area before switching.

- Inconsistency between debugger dot colors when showing lines with code
  Problem:    When the debugger preference "show lines with code" is set,
              unsetting a breakpoint will leave a blue dot.
  Workaround: Always enable the "show lines with code" preference.
