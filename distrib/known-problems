- KA13-020: GPS: skeleton.py doesn't always insert header

  Workaround: Save the first new file before opening a new one.

- KA18-030: GPS: hang using smart completion on multi-language project
  Problem:    GPS starts consuming too much CPU on large projects containing C
              and/or C++ files.
  Workaround: Disable Smart Completion in Preferences => Editor.

- K926-014: GB: GNATbench freezes when viewing/editing Ada files
  Problem:    Randomly when using the GNATbench Ada editor for code edition
              or program debug, GNATbench freezes. The only solution to get
              rid of the lock is to kill GNATbench, and launch it back.
  Workaround: - Run menu Window => Preferences
              - Open Ada => Editor preferences page
              - Disable the 3 following features
                1- Tooltips should be displayed automatically.
                2- Enable Code Assist.
                3- Enable Code Assist auto activation.

- K325-019: GPS: autofix for lines containing only spaces
  Problem:    The autofix for blanks at end of line removes the whole line if
              the line is composed only by spaces.
  Workaround: Do not use autofix on such lines or replace manually the removed
              line by an empty line.
