Known Problems fixed in GPS 2.0.0

- D128-002 Absolute paths generated when adding project dependencies
  Problem:    When a new dependency is added between two projects, an absolute
              path is almost always generated, no matter what the preference
              "Relative project paths" is.
  Workaround: Edit the project properties, unset the "Paths should be relative",
              and press OK. Edit again the properties and set back the button.
              You can then save the project, and all absolute paths have been
              converted to absolute

- Duplicate new file names
  Problem:    Creating several new files, and closing one that is not the last
              one, and creating a new one again result in a name duplication,
              and gets GPS confused
  Workaround: Save the files as soon as possible. Added benefit is a proper
              recognition of the language

- CB18-012 Different behavior between VCS global and contextual menus.
  Problem:    When you use the global menu VCS->Query status for all projects,
              only the status for project source files are queried, whereas
              when using the corresponding contextual menu, the status for all
              files, including non-source files, in the project directories
              are queried.
- Workaround: Use the contextual menu if you want to query status for
              non-source files.

- Block folding not compatible with extended character sets
  Problem:    When a block contains extended characters, folding this block
              causes loss of text.
  Workaround: Do not use block folding on source files which contain
              extended characters.

- C915-006 Incorrect refresh of line numbers
  Problem:    Sometimes scrolling source editors up and down using the
              scrollbar cause line numbers to be incorrectly displayed.
  Workaround: Scrolling using the keyboard refreshes the line display.

- Debugger specified on the command line not used by 'Debug->Initialize'
  Problem:    When launching gps with the --debugger switch, creating
              new debugger using Debug->Initialize will not take this
              switch into account
  Workaround: Edit the project properties to change the debugger command

- The title of windows is not remembered from one session to another
  Problem:    When the Entities Browser, the Project Browser or the Dependency
              Browser is open, exiting GPS and restarting will create those
              browsers with no titles.
  Workaround: Close these windows and launch the browser in the usual fashion.
