Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.4.0

- I114-032: Big memory footprint at startup
  Problem:    When GPS starts, it already uses a lot of memory. Some analysis
              Showed that a good chunk of it was from loading the
              $HOME/.gps/properties.xml file in memory in an inefficient
              datastructure
  Workaround: remove or cleanup this file once in a whiile. It will not get
              very big unless you are using the filepos.py plugin

- I113-033: Unexpected scrolling when switching between views of same file
  Problem:    If you have two views of the same file side by side, and scroll
              one of them so that its cursor is no longer visible, then click
              inside the other one, the latter gets scrolled randomly and the
              cursor is not moved to the line you clicked on
  Workaround: scroll back to that line

- HC10-015: Wrong text replacement with auto-casing
  Problem:    When auto-casing is enabled in the preferences, the wrong
              text replacement can occur if there are single quotes in the text
              being considered.
  Workaround: Edit the wrong replacement manually.

- HC09-008: Bad handling of --display
  Problem:    The command line switch --display is not handled correctly by GPS
  Workaround: Set the environment variable DISPLAY instead. If you need to
              spawn applications from GPS to another display, you can write
              a small python plug-in that does:
                  import os; os.environ["DISPLAY"]="..."
