Known Problems fixed in GPS 2.0.0

- Output of external commands not visible
  Problem:    If you specify an external command to be executed through a
              customization file, the command and its output were not visible in
              the Messages window
  Workaround: Do an explicit call to "echo" if your custom action

- Duplicate new file names
  Problem:    Creating several new files, and closing one that is not the last
              one, and creating a new one again result in a name duplication,
              and gets GPS confused
  Workaround: Save the files as soon as possible. Added benefit is a proper
              recognition of the language

- CB18-012 Different behavior between VCS global and contextual menus.
  Problem:    When you use the global menu VCS->Query status for all projects,
              only the status for project source files are queried, whereas
              when using the corresponding contextual menu, the status for all
              files, including non-source files, in the project directories
              are queried.
- Workaround: Use the contextual menu if you want to query status for
              non-source files.

- Block folding not compatible with extended character sets
  Problem:    When a block contains extended characters, folding this block
              causes loss of text.
  Workaround: Do not use block folding on source files which contain
              extended characters.

- C915-006 Incorrect refresh of line numbers
  Problem:    Sometimes scrolling source editors up and down using the
              scrollbar cause line numbers to be incorrectly displayed.
  Workaround: Scrolling using the keyboard refreshes the line display.

- Debugger specified on the command line not used by 'Debug->Initialize'
  Problem:    When launching gps with the --debugger switch, creating
              new debugger using Debug->Initialize will not take this
              switch into account
  Workaround: Edit the project properties to change the debugger command

- The title of windows is not remembered from one session to another
  Problem:    When the Entities Browser, the Project Browser or the Dependency
              Browser is open, exiting GPS and restarting will create those
              browsers with no titles.
  Workaround: Close these windows and launch the browser in the usual fashion.
