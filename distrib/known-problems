Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.4.0

- I202-039: Smart completion window behavior when scrolling
  Problem:    The smart completion window stays open when scrolling the editor,
              which can make it difficult to read text. Also, this causes the
              first click on the editor to scroll back to the place where the
              completion window was invoked.
  Workaround: Click once to cancel the smart completion window.

- I120-033: && should be "and then" not correctly auto-fixed
  Problem:    The auto-fix made for messages such as "&& should be "and then""
              is incorrect, it adds an unexpected quote at the location of the
              fix.
  Workaround: Manually delete the extra quote.

- I117-011: Fail to commit activities on Windows
  Problem:    GPS could fail to commit activities using Cygwin/Subversion
              on Windows when a filename is passed on the command line with
              the wrong casing. Windows is non case-sensitive but keeps
              filename casing. Using different casing for the pathname
              confuses Cygwin/Subversion which checks that all files, part
              of a group commit, are all under the same repository.
  Workaround: Make sure that proper casing is used on GPS command-line.

- I115-004: Location View: "secondary" locations attached to wrong node
  Problem:    When the compiler emits information concerning the same line
              and same column in two different files, GPS might place the
              "secondary" locations (ie, the locations line containing the
              hyperlink to the referenced file) on the node corresponding to
              the wrong file.
  Workaround: Read the compiler messages from the Messages window.

- I114-032: Big memory footprint at startup
  Problem:    When GPS starts, it already uses a lot of memory. Some analysis
              Showed that a good chunk of it was from loading the
              $HOME/.gps/properties.xml file in memory in an inefficient
              datastructure
  Workaround: remove or cleanup this file once in a whiile. It will not get
              very big unless you are using the filepos.py plugin

- I113-033: Unexpected scrolling when switching between views of same file
  Problem:    If you have two views of the same file side by side, and scroll
              one of them so that its cursor is no longer visible, then click
              inside the other one, the latter gets scrolled randomly and the
              cursor is not moved to the line you clicked on
  Workaround: scroll back to that line

- HC10-015: Wrong text replacement with auto-casing
  Problem:    When auto-casing is enabled in the preferences, the wrong
              text replacement can occur if there are single quotes in the text
              being considered.
  Workaround: Edit the wrong replacement manually.

- HC09-008: Bad handling of --display
  Problem:    The command line switch --display is not handled correctly by GPS
  Workaround: Set the environment variable DISPLAY instead. If you need to
              spawn applications from GPS to another display, you can write
              a small python plug-in that does:
                  import os; os.environ["DISPLAY"]="..."

- HA29-005: Block folding/unfolding broken with blank lines
  Problem:    If you use the GPS shell/python command "Editor.add_blank_lines"
              to add a blank line right after a line which starts a foldable
              block, and then fold this block, text corruption might occur in
              the current editor.
  Workaround: Do not use Editor.add_blank_lines in combination with block
              folding.

- F927-006: Folded blocks are deleted too easily
  Problem:    If a block is folded, pressing "backspace" when the cursor is at
              the beginning of the line following the folded block will delete
              the entire folded block.
  Workaround: Use Undo to go back to previous state.

- E721-004: Lines cannot be removed after removing blank lines
  Problem:    When an editor has "blank lines" (for instance when the editor
              is part of a visual comparison), after these blank lines are
              removed, some line breaks might be left read-only, making it
              impossible to remove it using the backspace/delete keys.
  Workaround: Close the editor and reopen it.
