Known Problems fixed in GPS 5.3.0 / GNATbench 2.8.0

- M521-020: GPS: Unwanted scrolling in the editors when switching perspectives
  Problem:    When switching perspectives, for instance when entering or
              leaving a debug session, editors scroll and lose the current
              location.
  Workaround: None: scroll manually.

- M517-006: Completion on C pointers on structures does not work.
  Problem:    Writing the operator "->" after a pointer to an struct does not
              enable the completion feature proposing the fields of the target
              struct type.
  Workaround: Declare temporarily an auxiliary variable whose type is the
              target struct type; use this temporary variable to have available
              the completion feature, and thus select the desired target field;
              then replace the auxiliary variable by the pointer to the struct.

- M516-020: ECL: Tooltips when debugging ada application may call Ada function
  Problem:    When debugging an Ada application, the Ada Editor tooltip may
              call a debugged application function to get actual value to be
              displayed in the tooltip.
  Workaround: Disable tooltips feature through Ada > Editor preferences page.

- M424-052: GB: Stack overflow on startup
  Problem:    When starting Workbench or Eclipse with the Ada editor
              open, the construct analysis could lead to an infinitly
              recursive call.
  Workaround: Close the editor and restart Eclipse.

- M411-032: GB: Code Assist invocation may cause Eclipse to crash
  Problem:    Invocation of the Code Assist feature can cause a crash
              of GNATbench due to a deadlock.
  Workaround: Restart Eclipse and retry the operation.

- M410-048: GB: Standard locations not searched for project files
  Problem:    The standard locations for GNAT-defined project files
              such as ajis.gpr and jni.gpr were not searched, so
              these projects were not found, resulting in unresolved
              user project file references.
  Workaround: Specify the standard locations (e.g., .../lib/gnat) in
              either GPR_PROJECT_PATH or ADA_PROJECT_PATH.

- M324-004: GB: Stack size warning messages at startup
  Problem:    At startup SPARK & Codepeer plugins on linux may ask to
              to set the stack size to unlimited. This is unnecessary.
  Workaround: Ignore these messages.

- M322-021: Bad indentation of multiple aspect clauses
  Problem:    The indentation engine gets confused when multiple Ada 2012
              aspect clauses are specified on a record type.
  Workaround: Use attributes and pragmas instead of aspects.

- M319-007: GB: Hang at startup if GPR project build is launched automatically
  Problem:    If "Build Automatically" feature is "ON" and GNATbench last
              exit occured during a GPR project build, the future GNATbench
              starts may hang.
  Workaround: Disable "Build Automatically" feature adding the line
              "description.autobuilding=false" to the
              org.eclipse.core.resources.prefs file located in
              .metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings
              hidden folder of the workspace.

- M318-027: GB: Missing menus when editing Ada file not part of a GPR project
  Problem:    When Codepeer plugin is installed, and when an Ada file not part
              of the workspace's GNAT projects is edited, some menus
              (ex: breakpoints/watchpoints contextual menu) are not displayed,
              and exceptions are reported in the Error Log.
  Workaround: Import in the workspace a GNAT Project containing the Ada file.
              see menu File > Import... > Ada > Existing GNAT Project

- M305-055: Bad expansion of %gprbuild
  Problem:    %gprbuild in build targets gets expanded as gnatmake instead
              of gprbuild in case of an Ada only prefer, and the Default
              builder preference is set to Auto.
  Workaround: Set the Default builder preference to gprbuild.

- M305-044: GPS: Support of ASCII.NUL character in executable output
  Problem:    When running an execuable in a GPS console, if the executable
              returns ASCII.NUL characters as part of its output, then the
              output shown in the console is truncated to the first ASCII.NUL.
  Workaround: Use an external console to run the executable.

- M304-016: Bad indentation of comment in the middle of a separate declaration
  Problem:    When indenting code of the form:
                separate (Foo)
                -- comment
                procedure Bar is
              the comment line is indented an extra level using the
              continuation lines setting.
  Workaround: Ignore this incorrect indentation, fix the indentation manually,
              or put the comment before the separate.

- M130-025: GPS: Cannot remove CodePeer categories from Locations View
  Problem:    Messages' categories for CodePeer race conditions are not removed
              on close of CodePeer report window when it was attempted to be
              removed from Locations View manually.
  Workaround: Restart GPS.

- M125-011: GPS: use all type clause corrupts outline view & vertical bracket
  Problem:    when Ada 2012 use all type clause is used, the displayed
              vertical bracket around blocks may be wrong. The Outline view
              also may display wrong data.
  Workaround: None.

- M119-001: GPS: crash when loading an erroneous project template
  Problem:    If you write a custom project template (.gpt) file, GPS will
              crash if the "Category" field is blank.
  Workaround: Make sure to enter a "Category" field in the .gpt file.

- M117-021: GPS: Put "Copy" near "Cut" and "Paste" in context menus
  Problem:    Menu items for Cut, Copy and/or Paste sometimes don't
              group together in contextual menu.
  Workaround: Rename "Copy" item to "Copy " in copy_paste.py file.

- M115-022: ECL: Android library not found when running app
  Problem:    The Ada project builder creates a folder in the associated
              Android project to hold the resulting dynamic library. This
              folder is named "libs/armeabi-v7a/" but that name is specific to
              that architecture. As a result, the Android OS will only load the
              library if the target architecture is compatible with the v7a
              version.
  Workaround: Rename the folder to remove the "-v7a" suffix if the target is
              indeed incompatible.  For a permanent fix, change the content of
              file "postbuild.mk" so that the value of ANDROID_TARGET_VERSION
              is "armeabi" instead.  Subsequent Ada builds will then create a
              libs folder with the more architecture-independent name.

- M103-017: Write references reported as read references
  Problem:    Variables passed in out-mode parameters are not listed as
              as write references.
  Workaround: None.

- LC11-030: GPS: Potential conflict when redefining key shortcuts
  Problem:    It is possible to associate by mistake key shortcuts to keys
              that are already bound because the key manager dialog does not
              display a warning for some keys (such as ctrl-f).
  Workaround: Verify the absence of collisions manually.

- LB30-018: Missing references with extending projects
  Problem:    If you are using extending projects, GPS will not
              parse its .ali files (containing the xref information generated
              by the compiler) if the corresponding source file does not
              exist in the extending project but only in the extended project.
  Workaround: Copying the source files from the extended project into the
              extending project will solve this issue, but is not very
              convenient.

- LB26-008: GPS: Smart completion of C/C++ parameters
  Problem:    When a function/method has several parameters, we press the
              open parenthesis, and we choose smart completion of all the
              parameters at once, then the number of added parameters added
              by GPS is correct but their names (shown as comments) is wrong.
  Workaround: Fix the name of the parameters manually.

- LB26-002: GPS: wrong comment highlighting after paste
  Problem:    When multiline Ada comment is pasted to the end of another
              comment line first line isn't highligthed properly.
  Workaround: None.

- LB21-035: GPS: wrong &lt char in locations
  Problem:    In Location View text created through scripting API has
              escaped markup characters.
  Workaround: None.

- LB21-033: GPS: Codefix of expanded names in redundant conversions
  Problem:    Fixing automatically warnings on redundant type conversions
              fails if the target type is an expanded name (that is, when
              the target type has a prefix like "x.y.t").
  Workaround: Avoid automatically fixing the code when the warning is reported
              in an expanded name.

- LB15-004: GB: Renaming gnatbench gpr file causes gnatbench properties issues
  Problem:    When renaming a gpr file and then updating gnatbench properties,
              if the project file name is not consistent with the gpr file
              name, Eclipse will crash.
  Workaround: Modify the project name in the gpr file to be consistent with the
              gpr filename.

- LB14-054: GPS: keyboard shortcuts not functional when Caps Lock is active
  Problem:    When Caps Lock is active, letter-based keyboard shortcuts for
              GPS actions do not work.
  Workaround: Create a wrapper action, bound to the capitalized version of the
              letter.

- LB13-012: GPS: The contextual menu to close other editors has been removed
  Problem:    The contextual menu appearing on notebook tabs to close other
              editors has been removed.
  Workaround: Use the menu File -> Close All Editors Except Current instead.

- LB09-038: GB: Crash due to unresolved dependencies in new project
  Problem:    When the new-project wizard creates an new AJIS or new Android
              project, Eclipse crashes without a log entry unless the user
              has specified the standard locations in either GPR_PROJECT_PATH
              or ADA_PROJECT_PATH.
  Workaround: Specify the standard locations (e.g., .../lib/gnat) in
              either GPR_PROJECT_PATH or ADA_PROJECT_PATH.

- LA23-019: Bad indentation of access procedure type in generic declaration
  Problem:    When indenting code of the form:
              generic
                 type T is access procedure;
              The indentation engine gets confused and wrongly indents the
              following statements.
  Workaround: Fix the indentation manually.

- LA12-039: GB: Excluded_Source_List_File change not applied
  Problem:    When using the Excluded_Source_List_File attribute, and entering
              an invalid file name in the referenced text file, an error
              is generated about the incorrect file name, even when fixing
              the file name manually or cleaning the project.
  Workaround: Restart Eclipse.

- LA12-034: GPS: wrong menu for target with custom name in extending project
  Problem:    When using an extending project which defines an executable name
              for a main which is defined in the extended project, GPS does not
              display the custom name in the "Run" menu, and the corresponding
              target cannot be launched through the menu or the toolbar button.
  Workaround: Use the Build->Run->Custom... menu

- LA11-026: GPS: C/C++ completion of entities defined in header files
  Problem:    GPS does not propose a list of entities for completion when the
              type of the prefix is defined in a header file.

  Workaround: Include manually the file.

- LA11-003: No xref from separate units compiled explicitly
  Problem:    If you use separate Ada units, and compile them explicitly from
              the editor (for instance /Build/Compile File), then no
              cross-reference is available anymore for that file.
  Workaround: Force the loading of all xref in memory, through
              /Build/Load Xref In Memory.

- L806-019: Ada 2012 aspect in type declaration corrupts completion & outline
  Problem:    If an aspect is used in a type declaration, it corrupts the
              completion database. The outline view may also be frozen.
  Workaround: Use pragmas instead of aspects.
