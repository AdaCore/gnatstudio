Known Problems fixed in GPS 5.2.0 / GNATbench 2.7.0

- L202-022: GPS: visual glitches when the Breakpoints editor is too small
  Problem:    When the Breakpoints editor is too small, there is a visual
              overlap in the display of its contents.
  Workaround: Resize, move, or float the Breakpoints editor.

- L131-031: GPS: jump to the current location when opening the search dialog
  Problem:    When the cursor in an editor is outside of the visible area,
              opening the Search dialog will cause the editor to scroll to
              show the position of the cursor.
  Workaround: Scroll manually, or position the cursor before opening the
              search dialog.

- L123-032: GPS Editing Library Interface in Project Properties
  Problem:    The project attribute Library_Interface must contain unit names.
              However, GPS will set it using file names instead, and as a
              result the compiler complains.
  Workaround: Edit the project manually (*.gpr).

- KC20-025: GPS: Removing a server makes some other servers unuseable
  Problem:    After removing a server from your server list, the other servers
              using the same shell or remote access tool become unuseable.
  Workaround: Remove the server manually from the .gps/remote.xml file.

- KC12-009: Find All References missing refs with extending projects
  Problem:    When searching for all references from a file in an extending
              project, GPS fails to report the references that are in files
              that are in other non-extending projects.
  Workaround: Manually load all Xref information via the /Build menu.

- KC01-011: GPS Show Entity <package> shows subprogram parameters
  Problem:    If you select the contextual menu Browsers/Show Entity for
              a package, the resulting box contains the parameters of the
              subprograms.
  Workaround: None.

- KA27-009: GPS: unwanted scrolling when canceling interactive search
  Problem:    When using the interactive search (plugin isearch.py), if the
              cursor is outside of the visible area, clicking on the editor
              to replace the cursor will cause unwanted scrolling.
  Workaround: Scroll back manually after the unwanted scrolling.

- K930-020: Recursive project source dirs and Windows host
  Problem:    When GPS is running on a Windows host, but driving a Unix
              build server, and the user edits the project to use recursive
              subdirectories, the syntax generated in the project file is
              Windows specific and rejected by the build server.
  Workaround: Edit the project manually to replace "\**" with "/**".

- K926-014: GB: GNATbench freezes when viewing/editing Ada files
  Problem:    Randomly when using the GNATbench Ada editor for code edition
              or program debug, GNATbench freezes. The only solution to get
              rid of the lock is to kill GNATbench, and launch it back.
  Workaround: - Run menu Window => Preferences
              - Open Ada => Editor preferences page
              - Disable the 3 following features
                1- Tooltips should be displayed automatically.
                2- Enable Code Assist.
                3- Enable Code Assist auto activation.

- K804-029: GPS: cannot bind Tab key to menus and use it to navigate
  Problem:    When assigning the Tab key to a menu, for instance
              /Edit/Format Selection, it is not possible to use the Tab key
              to navigate in the non-modal dialogs such as the Search dialog.
  Workaround: Use another key shortcut, or bind the Tab key to the
              corresponding action if it exists (for instance the action
              "Format Selection" in the "Editor" section in the Key Shortcuts
              view).

- K325-019: GPS: autofix for lines containing only spaces
  Problem:    The autofix for blanks at end of line removes the whole line if
              the line is composed only by spaces.
  Workaround: Do not use autofix on such lines or replace manually the removed
              line by an empty line.

- L113-025: GPS: cursor at wrong position after alias expansion
  Problem:    When alias text contains multibyte UTF-8 characters cursor is
              placed at wrong position after expansion.
  Workaround: Do not use multibyte UTF-8 characters in text of an alias.

- F816-013: GPS: Highlighting for comments in C with international characters
  Problem:    GPS does not properly compute the syntax coloring for comments
              which contain international characters in C sources.
  Workaround: No workaround.
