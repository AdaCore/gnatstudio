Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.4.0

- HC10-015: Wrong text replacement with auto-casing
  Problem:    When auto-casing is enabled in the preferences, the wrong
              text replacement can occur if there are single quotes in the text
              being considered.
  Workaround: Edit the wrong replacement manually.

- HC09-008: Bad handling of --display
  Problem:    The command line switch --display is not handled correctly by GPS
  Workaround: Set the environment variable DISPLAY instead. If you need to
              spawn applications from GPS to another display, you can write
              a small python plug-in that does:
                  import os; os.environ["DISPLAY"]="..."
