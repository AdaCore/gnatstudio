Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.5.0

KP-130-I612-002 Name Parameters and dotted notation

  Problem:    When a primitive operation is called using the new Ada05
              dotted notation, the refactoring Name Parameter was repeating
              the first parameter name (even though it is in fact given
              before the "."

  Status:     This was fixed in 4.5.0 on 2009-10-13

  Workaround: change to standard call, do the renaming, and then back to
              the dotted notation
