- G216-026 Outline View tooltips appearing outside of Outline View.
  Problem:    When the Outline View tooltips are enabled, it is possible that
              outline view tooltips appear even when the mouse pointer is out
              of the Outline View.
  Workaround: Move the mouse over the Outline View to cancel the tooltips, or
              disable the tooltips in the Outline View.
