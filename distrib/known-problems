Known Problems fixed in GPS 2.0.0

- D511-008 Bad handling of caps lock key under Windows
  Problem:    Under Windows only, the caps lock key is equivalent to having
              the shift key pressed. In particular this means that numeric
              keys are not handled correctly.
  Workaround: Press the shift key when needed to get the correct key.

- D415-005 Execution window is read-only after the first execution
  Problem:    If you run an external program using the menu Build->Run,
              after the process exits, the execution window becomes read-only
              and cannot be used to input text in following executions of the
              program.
  Workaround: Close the execution window before executing the second time.

- Pretty_Printer package generated in projects even when not used
  Problem:    The project wizard will create a Pretty_Printer package, even if
              no switch was set by the user. This creates a problem with GNAT
              versions older than 3.16, which don't support this package
  Workaround: Edit the project file manually to remove the package

- "Find all references" fails for GNAT runtime entities
  Problem:    If you try to find all the places where an entity from the
              GNAT runtime is referenced, only the results in the runtime
              itself or the root project are returned.
  Workaround: Create a project file that describes the location of the runtime,
              and import it from all other projects in your project tree

- D301-004 Invalid references to entities with Ada generics
  Problem:    Find All References will sometimes give incorrect results for
              entities declared in a generic (line and columns are correct,
              but file names are incorrect).
  Workaround: None found.

- The log files in directory log_files/ are not removed on Windows
  Problem:    After editing and committing a file the log file is not removed
              from the %HOME%\.gps\log_files directory under Windows.
  Workaround: Remove the file manually after exiting GPS.

- D108-007 Main files listed in the project file must end with source extension
  Problem:    If the list of main units listed in the project file is the name
              of an executable instead of a source file, GPS doesn't recognize
              it.
  Workaround: Specify the list of main source files in your manually edited
              projects.

- D128-002 Absolute paths generated when adding project dependencies
  Problem:    When a new dependency is added between two projects, an absolute
              path is almost always generated, no matter what the preference
              "Relative project paths" is.
  Workaround: Edit the project properties, unset the "Paths should be
              relative", and press OK. Edit again the properties and set back
              the button.
              You can then save the project, and all absolute paths have been
              converted to absolute.

- CC18-008 GPS does not check the "read-only" state of files when using VCS
  Problem:    When using CVS in a mode where file are read-only when they are
              not explicitely opened, or when using ClearCase, GPS does not
              check the read-only/writable state of the file after operations
              such as open, check-in, check-out.
  Workaround: Manually click the "Writable/Read Only" area in the editor.

- Duplicate new file names
  Problem:    Creating several new files, and closing one that is not the last
              one, and creating a new one again result in a name duplication,
              and gets GPS confused.
  Workaround: Save the files as soon as possible. Added benefit is a proper
              recognition of the language.

- CC10-007 Opaque resizing of windows on Windows doesn't work
  Problem:    If you have set the opaque mode in the preferences, and try to
              resize the windows, then GPS moves them instead.
  Workaround: Select the non-opaque mode.

- CB20-010 Project wizard creates existing object directory
  Problem:    If you select "use relative paths" in the project wizard, it
              happens that GPS suggests the creation of the object or exec
              directories, even though they already exist.
  Workaround: Answer Cancel to the dialog

- CB18-012 Different behavior between VCS global and contextual menus.
  Problem:    When you use the global menu VCS->Query status for all projects,
              only the status for project source files are queried, whereas
              when using the corresponding contextual menu, the status for all
              files, including non-source files, in the project directories
              are queried.
- Workaround: Use the contextual menu if you want to query status for
              non-source files.

- CB06-006 Wrong file name suggested when saving a.b unit
  Problem:    When creating an Ada unit called e.g. "a.b", GPS suggests the
              name a-b.adb instead of a~b.adb.
  Workaround: Fix the name manually when saving it.

- Block folding not compatible with extended character sets
  Problem:    When a block contains extended characters, folding this block
              causes loss of text.
  Workaround: Do not use block folding on source files which contain
              extended characters.

- C915-006 Incorrect refresh of line numbers
  Problem:    Sometimes scrolling source editors up and down using the
              scrollbar cause line numbers to be incorrectly displayed.
  Workaround: Scrolling using the keyboard refreshes the line display.

- Debugger specified on the command line not used by 'Debug->Initialize'
  Problem:    When launching gps with the --debugger switch, creating
              new debugger using Debug->Initialize will not take this
              switch into account.
  Workaround: Edit the project properties to change the debugger command.

- The title of windows is not remembered from one session to another
  Problem:    When the Entities Browser, the Project Browser or the Dependency
              Browser is open, exiting GPS and restarting will create those
              browsers with no titles.
  Workaround: Close these windows and launch the browser in the usual fashion.
