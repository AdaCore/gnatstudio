- Changing size of a font resets its color

              "File pattern" entry to
                 "^([^:]:?[^:]*):(\d+):((\d+):)? ((warning)?(\(style)?.*)".

- D531-001 Over alignment of variable declarations
  Problem:    When aligning the colon (':') character in variable declarations,
              the computation is not stopped when encountering a blank line.
