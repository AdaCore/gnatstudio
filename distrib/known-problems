Known Problems fixed in GPS 2.1.1

- DC30-003 Completion in File/Open From Project is always case sensitive
  Problem:    On windows, if you use the dialog Open From Project, you must
              type the file name with exactly the same casing as on the file
              system, whereas comparison should be case insensitive.
  Workaround: Use the appropriate casing

- DC20-008 Crash when viewing HTML files that contain special characters
  Problem:    When viewing in the GPS Help the Ada95 Reference Manual, or any
              HTML file that contains special characters, GPS may freeze or
              crash under Windows.
  Workaround: Use any standard HTML browser to open the corresponding file

- DC16-004 Removing an entry from a GPS.Combo fails in python
  Problem:    If you try to call GPS.Combo().remove(), you get an internal
              GPS error in the console
  Workaround: Clear the combo and recreate it instead

- DC15-011 Line numbering loses synchronization
  Problem:    When line numbers are displayed, adding or removing lines in
              one place may cause lines outside of the visible area to become
              associated to wrong numbers.
  Workaround: Adding or removing a line in the visible area restores
              synchronization.

- DC11-004 Fatal error when tiling and then maxizing windows
  Problem:    If you tile (horizontally or vertically) some windows in GPS,
              then double-click on the title bar to maximize the items, and
              finally select the Messages window, GPS will crash
  Workaround: Do not tile the window, use the Split feature instead

- DC06-007 Crash when selecting some fonts under Windows
  Problem:    When selecting some particular fonts (e.g. 'Serif') in the
              font selector under Windows, GPS will crash.
  Workaround: Select other fonts, or type the font name in the text entry
              directly.

- DC05-002 The command Refill was not filling up to the last column
  Problem:    If the last character in a word was ending in the last column
              the word was wrapped into the next line.
  Workaround: Fill the last word manually.

- DC03-028 GPS exits even though it couldn't save some files
  Problem:    If you exit GPS with some modified files, GPS displays a dialog
              asking which should be saved. However, if there is an error
              saving some of these, GPS will still exit, losing modification
  Workaround: Save the files through the File->Save All menu before exiting

- DC03-021 Custom project attributes must specify a default value for files
  Problem:    If you define your own project attributes through XML files, the
              ones that are of type file or directory must specify a default
              value.
  Workaround: Always specify default="." for such attributes

- DC03-019 Popup dialogs in project editors can be hidden by parent window
  Problem:    When you edit the value of some project attributes, like the
              compiler to use for Ada, a popup dialog is displayed. However,
              this dialog can go behind the project properties editor window,
              and thus be invisible to the user
  Workaround: Move the windows until you can find the popup dialog again

- DC02-018 Crash when using menu Show in assembly view
  Problem:    GPS will crash when using the contextual menu Show in the assembly
              view.
  Workaround: This menu is obsolete and has been removed. Instead, close
              the window to hide the assembly view, and use the menu
              Debug->Data->Assembly to show it.

- DB29-017 Freeze when resizing the memory view
  Problem:    When the display format is not "Byte", resizing the memory
              view causes GPS to freeze.
  Workaround: Switch to "Byte" format before resizing the memory view.

Known Problems fixed in GPS 2.1.0

- On Windows, opening file.ADB will not provide syntax highlighting
  Problem:    On systems with case insensitive file systems, GPS still
              expects the casing of base file names to be consistent in the
              project file and on the disk
  Workaround: use shift-F3 to open the file

- DA27-002 Detection of external changes only when timestamp is more recent
  Problem:    If you modify a file with an other editor than GPS, or through
              a version control system, GPS will only detect changes to that
              file if its new timestamp is earlier than before.
  Workaround: "touch" the file, or save again with an editor

- DA19-018 Casing not preserved for object and exec directories
  Problem:    In the project view (and in the result of current_context() in
              scripting languages), the object and exec directory names are
              converted to lower-cases on case-insensitive file systems
  Workaround: None for the project view, but in shell you can do a "cd" to
              that directory and getcwd() to read with the right casing.

- DA15-003 XML files: action not found when defined outside of theme
  Problem:    If a theme defines a menu which references an action defined
              outside of <theme>, the action is reported as not found
  Workaround: Define the action inside the <theme>, or at least a new action
              that just executes the first one through a call to the shell
              command GPS.execute_action.

- DA11-015 The auto-saved files can confuse some building mechanisms
  Problem:    When GPS is configured to automatically save the contents of the
              editors, the files created have the same extension as the
              original files, and this might be a problem in some building
              environment.
  Workaround: Remove all auto-saves before building

- DA11-007 Cross-references failing on Windows
  Problem:    In some cases, depending for instance on how and at what point
              the project file was loaded, the cross-references might fail
              on Windows (the contextual menu doesn't show the xref items).
  Workaround: Reload the file differently, e.g. using File->Open From Project

- DA10-004 Crash in "Find all local refs"
  Problem:    GPS sometimes crashes when calling the Find all locals
              refs contextual menu.
  Workaround: Use "Find all refs" instead

- When using CVS, operation "Query status for directory" is recursive
  Problem:    When using CVS, the operation "Query status for directory"
              the status for files in the sub-directories as well.
  Workaround: Prefer the use of "Query status for project"

- DA07-015 Bad indentation of C code
  Problem:    In C sources, the wrong indentation may be computed on lines
              starting with a '(' and only spaces before.
  Workaround: Indent the line by hand.

- DA05-024 In VCS XML definitions, <diff_working> node has no effect
  Problem:    When writing or modifying XML files for supporting a new VCS,
              the <diff_working> node has no effect.
  Workaround: Create a contextual menu item specifically for this effect

- D923-002 Empty directory selection on first display under Windows
  Problem:    Under Windows, when opening the directory selector for the first
              time, the dialog is empty and the "Exploring" field set to "."
  Workaround: Close the dialog and open it again.

- D920-004 The bottom of files may get corrupted when using block folding
  Problem:    When using block folding, GPS may change the order or corrupt the
              last lines in the file.
  Workaround: Do not use block folding

- Search misses occurrences in sources with tabs
  Problem:    The search tool will miss some occurrences if your source file
              contains tabs.
  Workaround: Do a search for all occurrences, and then click in the
              location window.

- Custom toolbar buttons are not shown when created through parse_xml
  Problem:    If you use the GPS shell command "parse_xml" to create toolbar
              buttons, those buttons are not displayed.
  Workaround: Use the XML files mechanism to create toolbar buttons

- D914-023 Sort order in Project View not kept when scenario changes
  Problem:    If you change the value of the environment variables that
              describe the current scenario, the list of directories in the
              project view will change appropriately, but the new directories
              are appended at the end, instead of keeping the sort order.
  Workaround: Close and reopen the project view to force a refresh

- D914-015 MDI docks size incorrectly restored when loading desktop
  Problem:    When a desktop file is read, the size of the docks (on each
              side of the main GPS window) is incorrectly restored
  Workaround: Resize them manually by drag-and-dropping the separator

- Directories in Project View contain no file after a change of scenario
  Problem:    If you select a new value for the scenario variables at the
              top of the project view, the directories that didn't exist
              in the previous scenario are correctly added, but contain
              no visible file
  Workaround: Close the project node, select again the scenario, and reopen
              the project node to force an update.

- D902-016 Project wizard print a warning if the directory contains a dot
  Problem:    If you use the project wizard to create a new project in
              a directory that contains a dot ('.'), GPS will display a
              warning about child projects.
  Workaround: This warning can be safely ignored

- D831-003 Ada runtime files not seen as direct sources of a project
  Problem:    If a project has one or more files with the same name as the
              Ada runtime, these files will not be displayed in the Project
              View, and cannot be open through the "Open From Project" menu
  Workaround: Edit the file with File->Open. This doesn't impact the build
              mechanism.

- D817-008 Closing the Run window does not always terminate execution.
  Problem:    In particular under Windows, and with multi-threaded programs,
              closing the Run window does not terminate the execution.
  Workaround: Terminate the program using "kill" (under UNIX) or the Windows
              task manager.

- D816-007 Double-clicking does not select identifiers containing digits
  Problem:    When an identifier contain digits, double-clicking on it does not
              select the entire word.
  Workaround: Select the identifier manually

- D806-007 Selecting text and pressing enter does not delete the selection
  Problem:    When there is a selection in an editor that has auto-indentation
              capabilities, the text is not deleted when pressing enter.
  Workaround: Delete the text by pressing the <delete> key

- D804-011 Focus switch leaves the editors in interactive selection mode
  Problem:    When selecting text in editors using the mouse, if an external
              window grabs the focus, the editor is stuck in selection mode and
              GPS might crash when closing this editor.
  Workaround: There is no workaround for this problem

- D803-001 It is possible to set breakpoints on lines with no code
  Problem:    When the debugger preference "Show lines with code" is enabled,
              it is still possible to set breakpoints on lines that do not
              contain code.
  Workaround: This behavior is harmless. The meaning of a breakpoint on a line
              with no code is that it is set on the first line containing code
              after this line

- D802-017 GPS scrolls back to line 1 when opening an already opened file
  Problem:    If you double-click on a file name in the explorer (or
              select it in the Open From Project menu), and the file is
              already opened, GPS will show the file but scroll back to
              line 1
  Workaround: Select the file through the Window menu

- D721-004 Typing in floating read-only editors writes in other editors
  Problem:    When you type characters in a read-only floating editor, the
              actual editing might occur in a non-floating editor instead.
  Workaround: Do not type in read-only floating editors

- D715-006 Drag-and-drop a window on another floating window fails
  Problem:    If you are trying to make a window floating by dragging it
              and dropping over an already floating window, GPS will in
              fact put the new window in one of its docks instead of
              floating it.
  Workaround: Drop the window outside any GPS window, floating or not

- D707-010 In the Locations View, line numbers are hard to read
  Problem:     On the currently selected line in the locations view, the line
               and column number are written in black on a dark blue background
               and are therefore hard to read.
  Workaround:  Select another line or give the focus to another component

- D615-009 References highlighting is confused by TABs
  Problem     When navigating through search results in the Locations view,
              the highlighting is wrong on lines that contain TABs before the
              reference.
  Workaround: Convert TABs into spaces

- D515-001 "Tasks are running" window shows internal processings of GPS
  Problem:    When launching GPS and exiting quickly, or when exiting right
              after opening a new editor, GPS opens the "Tasks are running"
              window and shows internal GPS commands.
  Workaround: These messages can safely be ignored

- Using "Locate in explorer" from VCS Explorer doesn't work
  Problem:    When using the contextual menu on an entry in the VCS Explorer
              and using "Locate in Explorer: ...", nothing happens.
  Workaround: Double-click on the entry to open the file, and use "Locate in
              explorer" on the file editor.

- Changing size of a font resets its color
  Problem:    In the preferences dialog, changing the size of a font resets
              its foreground and background colors to the default values.
  Workaround: Set the color again explicitely

- D622-018 Duplicate references returned for entities with no separate spec
  Problem:    If you call "Find all references" on a subprogram with no
              separate spec, a duplicate reference is returned.
  Workaround: None found, except adding a separate spec

- D614-009 Errors in C files are not displayed in the Locations window
  Problem:    Under Windows, the errors produced by compilation of C files are
              not visible in the Locations window.
  Workaround: Open the Preferences, in the "Messages" section, and change the
              "File pattern" entry to
                 "^([^:]:?[^:]*):(\d+):((\d+):)? ((warning)?(\(style)?.*)".

- D531-001 Over alignment of variable declarations
  Problem:    When aligning the colon (':') character in variable declarations,
              the computation is not stopped when encountering a blank line.
  Workaround: Indent manually when needed

- CC24-001 Font dialog incorrectly initialized in preferences dialog
  Problem:    When editing fonts through the Edit->Preferences dialog, the
              font dialog that pops up always has "sans 10" selected initially,
              instead of the current font
  Workaround: Select manually the font you want to use

- CB30-002 Wrong behavior when double-clicking on the tab
  Problem:    When double-clicking on the tab the windows get properly resized
              only if there is more than 2 files opened.
  Workaround: Use "Window" -> "Unmaximize All" instead
