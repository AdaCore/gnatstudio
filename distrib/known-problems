Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.3.3

- I608-005: Reformat may lose character constants
  Problem:    When reformatting an aggregate that contains a character constant
              as the first non blank token and an arow in the same line, the
              character cosntant may get erasen.
  Workaround: Disable the 'Align associations on arrows' preference.

- I507-015: Problems with completion on illegal Ada files
  Problem:    Querying the smart completion on an illegal Ada file, in 
              particular with entities not correctly closed, may give
              wrong results and log error messages.
  Workaround: Manually complete the code.

- I501-005: GPS 'show VC' and 'Show Simplified VC' is slighlty off
  Problem:    When selecting 'show VC' and 'Show Simplified VC', the user is
              taken to the VC in the .vcg or .siv file but it has moved
              the current line forward by three lines.
  Workaround: Just click on the right line which is only just above the
              current line.

- I430-008: Error message when GPS us launched with --debug alone
  Problem:    When launching "gps --debug"with no executable, an error message
              is displayed that the executable specified was not found.
  Workaround: Ignore the dialog box (click OK) or specify an executable on
              the command line.

- I428-003: SPARK Help menu is Examiner only
  Problem:    There is no help for the other SPARK tools in the SPARK menu.
  Workaround: Access the spark documentation manually.

- I421-010: Documentation generation issue with non-utf8 compatible comments
  Problem:    When an Ada specification contains non-utf8 characters, then the
              documentation generation will fail.
  Workaround: Use utf-8 or ascii only comments.

- I414-026: SPARK Examine file loses focus
  Problem:    When using the "Examine file" spark action, the focus is switched
              to the spark console, and the current file looses the focus
  Workaround: Click on the source editor to gain the focus again.

- I330-016: Issue when editing files switches
  Problem:    When editing an Ada file's switch options, the Ada tab might be
              empty.
  Workaround: Use the project editor first, then retry editing the Ada file's
              switches.

- I327-048: Order of preferences changes
  Problem:    The order of lines in the preferences dialog might change
              from one session of GPS to the next
  Workaround: None needed, all lines are always visible. The order depends
              on the order of lines in the preferences file

- I306-002: Makefile.py confused by ':' on command lines
  Problem:    If you are using a Makefile where some commands include a
              colon (for instance "echo foo:test"), GPS will incorrectly
              parse that line as being the target "echo foo", and will show
              it in the menu
  Workaround: This only impacts the menu (visual glitch)

- I304-012: Gnatcheck menus not working
  Problem:    When using the contextual menu "Check Coding Standard of file in
              project" or when using the Tools->Coding Standard->Check* menus,
              GPS reports that gnatcheck is not available.
  Workaround: Editing first the coding standard file (menu Tools->Coding
              Standard->Edit coding standard) will make GPS being able to
              run gnatcheck.

- I303-017: Location view does not always jump to build output location
  Problem:    In some cases, the location view doesn't scroll properly to
              show the first build error.
  Workaround: Scroll manually using the scrollbar or mouse.

- I302-023: Preserve current directory in SPARK plugin
  Problem:  SPARKMake searches for files in and under the current working
            directory. The spark.py was changed to temporarily set the
            current directory as appropriate
  Workaround: use /File/Change Directory... to set the directory manually

- I213-026: Crash while doing search & replace on Windows
  Problem:    When doing a search and replace, at the end of the search, if
              the user answers yes to the popup asking if he wants to start
              from the beginning, GPS may sometimes crash.
  Workaround: Answer no, and run a new search & replace session.

- I212-042: Spurious GtkWarning message under Windows
  Problem:    Under Windows, GPS sometimes displays spurious GtkWarning
              messages in the Message window such as:
              sys:1: GtkWarning: gdkdrawable-win32.c:1607: BitBlt failed:...
  Workaround: This message is harmless and can be safely ignored.

- I210-053: GPS does not run on Linux glibc 2.3 and Xorg
  Problem:    GPS 4.3.1 will not run on some GNU Linux systems using glibc 2.3
              and Xorg.
  Workaround: Create a symbolic link from lib/gps-xfree to lib/gps instead of
              the default lib/gps-xorg -> lib/gps.

- I206-024: Main window not always uniconified under Windows
  Problem:    When the search window is open and floating, and the main
              GPS window iconified, double-cliking on a source file in the
              Windows explorer will not raise the GPS main window.
  Workaround: Uniconify the main window manually.

- I204-012: Loading executable in the debugger changes the current directory
  Problem:    When using the menu Debug->Debug->Load File... to load an
              executable, the current working directory of GPS changes to the
              directory containing the executable.
  Workaround: Use the menu File->Change Directory to change the working
              directory.

- I128-009: Issue when modifying the toolchain from the project editor
  Problem:    When modifying the gnatmake parameter from the project editor,
              (when setting a cross-compiler for example), the new value is not
              taken into account immediately.
  Workaround: Using the menu "Project->Reload project" makes GPS correctly take
              the new value for gnatmake into account.

- I122-008: Installation does not keep existing documentation plug-ins
  Problem:    When installing GPS, if you have some existing plug-ins
              (e.g. from a gnat or gprbuild installation) that provide access
              to documentation in the GPS help menu, these documents will not
              be available in the help menu.
  Workaround: Reinstall the missing .xml file after installing GPS, or access
              the documentation outside GPS.

- FB07-017: Saving does not cancel Smart Completion window
  Problem:    Saving the contents of a file editor using the associated key
              shortcut does not cause the Smart Completion window to
              disappear.
  Workaround: Use another method to cancel the Smart Completion window, such as
              clicking in the editor or pressing "ESC".

Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.3.1

- HC18-007: File totals for gcov-based file coverage are wrong
  Problem:    When using GPS coverage tools (in menu Tools->Coverage), the
              totals of lines reported in the coverage tree for file nodes
              are wrong.
  Workaround: Ignore this total, use the totals for subprograms or the
              coverage annotations instead.

- HC12-017: Cannot force specific word in debugger contextual menu
  Problem:    If you right-click inside the selection, the debugger contextual
              menu uses that selection as the name of the entity. But this
              does not work when selecting the last component of an expression
              ("C" in "A.B.C"), where the full expression is always sent to
              the debugger
  Workaround: Type "graph display C" in the debugger console

- HC09-027: Debug->Display does not work with non-ASCII characters
  Problem:    When there are non ASCII characters in a file, the Debug->Display
              menu does not parse correctly the variable and uses a truncated
              name.
  Workaround: Do the command directly from the gdb console: "graph display xxx".

- HC09-013: Problem when switching from one project to another
  Problem:    On some occasions, switching from one project to another make the
              new project not being correctly loaded.
  Workaround: Exit GPS, then start with the new project.

- HC04-030: GPS incorrectly handles remote gdb through telnet on Windows server
  Problem:    When connecting to a Windows server using telnet, the remote mode
              of GPS does not handle the echoed commands sent to gdb, so views
              them as answers.
  Workaround: Set 'set editing off' in the debug window to improve things,
              or use a local GPS.

- HC02-018: Debug->Display does not always work correctly
  Problem:    In some cases, for example in a code like "A => B", doing a
              Debug->Display on B will query the value of "A=B" instead of B.
  Workaround: Do the command directly from the gdb console: "graph display B".

- HC01-020: Tooltips cancel "dragging" of selection in editors
  Problem:    On source editors, while dragging with the mouse to expand the
              selection, if the cursor stays on an entity and a tooltip is
              displayed, the selection is no longer expanded.
  Workaround: Disable the tooltips, or use shift + click to resume the
              expansion of the selection.

- HC01-017: Handling of maximized window under Windows
  Problem:    Under Windows, if you minimize a maximized window, and then
              restore it, it will not be restored to a maximized state.
  Workaround: Restore the window size manually.

- HC01-014: Color selection under Windows
  Problem:    Under Windows, the color selection widget in the preferences
              dialog cannot be manipulated easily with the mouse.
  Workaround: Enter the color value in the text entry instead of using the
              mouse.

- HB25-026: Opening GPS with the build mode set creates a dummy subdirectory.
  Problem:    When opening GPS with the build mode set to a mode different from
              "default" will create a subdirectory in the current directory,
              according to the selected mode, and whatever the opened project's
              object directories.
  Workaround: Open GPS with the build mode set to "default", or delete the
              subdirectory afterwards.

- HB25-024: Reset output window when running executables
  Problem:    If you run an executable (/Buid/Run menu) several times in a row
              without closing the output window between each run, then the
              window is not longer executable after the first run (no blinking
              cursor among other symptoms)
  Workaround: Close the window between runs

- HB23-003: "Compile file" failure on Windows caused by casing
  Problem:    Under windows, if the source directories declared in a project
              file do not have the same casing as the actual directories, then
              the action /Build/Compile File may fail.
  Workaround: Change your project file to define paths matching exactly the
              actual path.

- HB23-002: Wrong order of Main files in Build and Run menus
  Problem:    The Main files defined in the Root project are listed last.
              As a result, by default the "F4" and "F2" key shortcuts
              do not respectively compile and run the first Main file
              in the root project, if there are Main files defined in
              subprojects.
  Workaround: The key shortcuts can be changed via the Key Shortcuts Manager.

- HB21-038: Cannot use native Win32 aspell program with ispell plug-in
  Problem:    If you enable the ispell.py plug-in, GPS appears to hang when
              using the native Win32 aspell program and will never report any
              spelling errors.
  Workaround: Use a Cygwin version of aspell.

- H904-015: Files status disappearing from VCS Explorer
  Problem:    When committing a file or editing a revision log file
              statuses (Needs update and Needs merge) are disappearing
              from the VCS Explorer.
  Workaround: Launch a Query Status action to get back the statuses.

- HB21-028: GPS.execute_action does not work for /Window menu
  Problem:    The python command GPS.execute_action can not be used for the
              items in the /Window menu.
  Workaround: Use the GPS.MDI.get() python function if you want to raise a
              window

- HB20-009: Wrong fonts used in the Editor on some Linux distributions
  Problem:    Under some Linux distributions, GPS may use default fonts
              for the source editor which are not fixed width fonts.
  Workaround: Edit the prefix/bin/gps wrapper script and replace all
              occurrences of $root/etc/fonts by /etc/fonts.

- HB20-008: Remote mode might hang on Windows
  Problem:    The remote on Windows has two ways of spawning remote access
              tools: either by simply redirecting input/output default
              handlers or by inspecting the console of the spawned application
              and emulating a tty communication. The latter may hang sometimes.
  Workaround: Set "use_pipes=true" in protocols.xml for access tools that
              you want to use. Note that in this mode, you need a passwordless
              connection.

- HB20-007: Default value in <preference> node incorrect
  Problem:    GPS 4.3.0 contained an unexpected change of behavior for the
              "default" attribute of <preference> node in customization files,
              for preferences with a value in a specific set of choices. 0
              used to be for the first possible value, but GPS 4.3.0 is using
              1 here. This change has been reverted, and 0 once again means the
              first possible value, for backward compatibility reasons.
  Workaround: Change 0 to 1 temporarily to make your customization file work
              with 4.3.0.

- HB19-014: SPARK examiner messages no longer recognized
  Problem:    Error messages from the SPARK Examiner are no longer recognized
              in GPS 4.3.0 and not displayed in the locations window
  Workaround: Use the spark.py plug-in from previous GPS versions.

- HB17-012: Multiple entity databases loading at the same time
  Problem:    While loading the entity database, if the project is updated
              manually, or when the build mode is changed, there may be a n
              extra recomputing of the entity database launched in parallel of
              the current one, instead of having the current one removed first.
  Workaround: Wait until the end of the load.

- HB17-006: Wrong coverage highlighting
  Problem:    GPS doesn't update the list of uncovered lines in the locations
              window after reloading coverage information for a single file.
              As a side effect covered lines may be highlighted as uncovered
              lines.
  Workaround: Hide and show coverage information for the file using the source
              editor's contextual menu after reloading coverage information.

- HB17-002: Changing the build mode may crash GPS under Windows
  Problem:    Under certain circumstances and under Windows only, changing the
              build mode of GPS when the object subdirectories do not exist
              make GPS crash.
  Workaround: Relaunching GPS and changing the mode is working as the
              subdirectories are then created. You can also create those
              subdirectories manually before changing the mode.

- HB13-014: Cannot load files with NUL characters
  Problem:    GPS ignores characters beyond a NUL character when loading
              a source file in an editor. It will now strip the NUL character
              and take into account the reamining file contents.
  Workaround:  Remove the NUL characters before loading the file in GPS.

- HB13-012: Invalid desktop saved
  Problem:    In some cases when generating code coverage information for
              C files containing multiple line macros, the desktop will
              contain invalid characters that cannot be loaded afterwards.
  Workaround: Remove the invalid (NUL) characters from .gps/desktop.xml
              manually.

- HB13-008: Build mode not taken into account in interactive dialog
  Problem:    When running a build action (e.g. from the Build menu) which
              pops up an extra interactive dialog to confirm the command line,
              the build mode (gcov, debug, ...) will not be taken into account
  Workaround: either use the default build mode, or specify an extra
              --subdirs=xxx switch in the interactive dialog.

- HB05-010: Remote mode not working using telnet with Windows target
  Problem:    Depending on the target and remote access tool used, GPS needs
              to send its commands using a trailing CR/LF sequence, instead of
              a single LF character. This is now detected automatically, and
              can also be overriden manually in the server configuration.
  Workaround: Add <Use_Cr_Lf>True</Use_Cr_Lf> tag in the Telnet tool definition
              in protocols.xml.

- HB04-009: Debugger console has no keyboard focus on title click
  Problem:    If you click in the title bar or the tab of the debugger
              console, the cursor is not activated in the console, and
              you need to click inside it before typing
  Workaround: Click in the middle of the console to give it focus

- HB04-006: Messages window not cleared after failed build
  Problem:    If a build fails because the specified executable cannot
              be executed (for instance if the executable does not exist,
              or if the permissions forbid execution of the executable),
              then the Messages window does not get cleared up at the
              beginning of subsequent compilations.
  Workaround: Fix the build configuration to specify a valid executable,
              and restart GPS.

- HB01-005: Wrong scrolling to end of location window
  Problem:    The location window is scrolled to show the last item
              in some cases instead of showing the selected item.
  Workaround: Scroll back to the selected item.

- H123-027: Wrong fixes for "not fully conformant" with accept statements
  Problem:    The auto-fix proposed for "not fully conformant" error messages
              does not work when the error appears on a accept statement.
  Workaround: Manually fix the code.

Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.3.0

- HA14-009: Wrong dialog settings in project properties
  Problem:    On Vista the dialog checks for proper file permissions. As the
              dialog on the project properties (to select a global pragma
              file for example) was set in "save" mode it was not possible
              to select a file which was read-only.
  Workaround: Change file permissions to read-write

- HA05-007: Cannot create .gps directory for path with non ASCII characters
  Problem:    If the HOME (or GPS_HOME) environment variable contains
              non ASCII characters, GPS fails to create the .gps
              directory.
  Workaround: Use a GPS_HOME which contains only plain ASCII characters

- I319-021: Wrong block completion when no space between name and parameters.
  Problem:    For procedures, functions and entries, if the routine name is
              not followed by a space the block completion was including
              the first parameter.
  Workaround: Edit manually to remove the parameter name.

- H915-002: File view from project filter no working
  Problem:    On the file view when activating the
              "Show files from project only" filter there is nothing
              displayed.
  Workaround: Do not activate the filter or use the project explorer

- H909-012: Wrong setting of gprbuild --target switch
  Problem:    When using a full pathname for the gnatmake command in the
              project file (e.g. "c:/gnatpro/bin/powerpc-elf-gnatmake"), GPS
              will launch gprbuild with the wrong --target switch.
  Workaround: Launch gprbuild using the Build->Make->Custom... menu, or use
              gprmake.

- H903-019: Generated documentation is displayed incorrectly with IE6
  Problem:    The documentation generator engine of GPS generates html code
              that uses the CSS style "white-space: pre;" which is not handled
              by IE6.
  Workaround: Use Firefox, IE7, Opera or Safari. They are known to handle
              correctly this CSS style.

- H902-002: Duplicate locations for SPARK Examiner error messages
  Problem:    If you use the spark module and examine a file, it happens
              that the location window has duplicate entries for error
              messages with lines greater than 100.
  Workaround: Ignore those extra lines, they have no impact on the result

- H805-023: Some references referred to as "read references"
  Problem:    When you search for references to an entity, GPS will report
              some of these as "read reference" when they really are just an
              occurrence of the name. The GNAT compiler does not make a
              distinction between the two cases, and such references are now
              marked as "reference"
  Workaround: None needed, this is just textual

- H730-020: List of main files cleared after a scenario change
  Problem:    When changing the value of a scenario variable for a project file
              that declares a main file with an empty name such as in:
                 for Main use ("");
              the list of main files in the Build/Make and Build/Run menus is
              cleared. Furthermore, those menus contain unexpected separators
              (one per main file with an empty name).
  Workaround: Although syntactically correct, this pattern has an undefined
              semantics. The right syntax to achieve the desireable goal is
              the following:
                 for Main use (); --  Note that double quotes have been removed

- H725-018: Refactoring->Rename does not ignore casing
  Problem:    When using the 'Rename' refactoring, identifiers are not
              considered with insensitive casing, thus failing to modify
              some occurrences
  Workaround: Use the Search & Replace capability instead.

- H725-002: Miscomputation of highlighling when using visual comparison
  Problem:    When using the visual comparison feature of GPS (via the
              /Tools/Compare/* or the /VCS/Compare* menus), the portion of
              lines that have been modified are highlighted. In some cases
              this fine grained highlighting will not appear at places it
              should.
  Workaround: No known workaround. As the line is modified, it will be
              be highlighted though, but the exact characters on the line that
              are modified will not.

- H724-004: Cannot search for package instantiation
  Problem:    If you use the contextual menu "Find References to ..." on a
              generic package, and then ask to only see its instantiations,
              you will currently not get any output
  Workaround: Look for "read references" to that package.

- H716-010: filedeps.py plug-in missing some dependencies
  Problem:    If you search, through this plug-in, why file A depends on file
              B, it is possible that the plug-in does not find any such
              dependency whereas the compiler detects one
  Workaround: Update the filedeps.py script. You do not need a new version of
              GPS.

- H714-013: Protection domains menu disabled with wtx4 debugger
  Problem:    The "Protection Domains" menu entry is not enabled when
              using a VxWorks653 wtx4-based debugger
  Workaround: Use the debugger console to access this information. Use
              "info pds" to list protection domains, and "pd <pd id>" to
	      switch between domains.

- H711-009: GPS hangs when closing and opening files
  Problem:    Under some circumstances, GPS might hang when opening a file
              and potentially crash. An identified scenario is when two new
              files are created using GPS, saved, closed, and opened again.
              A similar behavior can be observed when renaming a file.
  Workaround: Create new files or rename files outside GPS before loading them.

- H630-002: Incorrect file in xref after changing scenario
  Problem:    GPS incorrectly resets its internal xref cache when the scenario
              variables are changed. Do a query from file A, which ends into
              file B (for instance B contains the body of an entity referenced
              in A). Then change the scenario so that the object directories
              are now different, and B no longer belongs to the project. If
              you redo the same query as before, you will again end up in B,
              whereas you should end up in another file C instead.
  Workaround: Put the following python file in $HOME/.gps/plug-ins:
              import GPS
              def on_view_changed (h): GPS.reset_xref_db()
              GPS.Hook ("project_view_changed").add (on_view_changed)

- H612-018: GPS hangs when it cannot write to the log file
  Problem:    Due to special circumstances, GPS might not be able to write to
              the log file (e.g NFS errors) and as a result just hangs.
  Workaround: Remove the first line of the traces.cfg file that is located
              under %USERPROFILE%/.gps on Windows or $HOME/.gps/ on other
              platforms and which contains ">log.$$".

- H612-013: Inability to set breakpoints at some locations
  Problem:    Recent GNAT Pro packages comes with a new version of GDB (6.8)
              which makes use of a new feature that is not properly handled
              by GPS (multiple locations breakpoints). As a result it might not
              be possible to set breakpoints in some particular locations.
              Furthermore, after GPS refused to set a breakpoint, it is not
              possible to open the breakpoint editor. Finally, this can also
              generate some instabilities.
  Workaround: It can help to compile with no optimization (-O0). Otherwise it
              is still possible to use an older version of GDB (coming from a
              previous release of GNAT Pro).

- H704-007: Closing nodes in call graph still shows locations
  Problem:    If you select the contextual menu "... calls", you get a
              call tree, which shows location on its right-hand part. If
              you fold the toplevel node, the locations are still visible,
              although clicking on them has no effect
  Workaround: Expand the node again, and select the entity for which you
              want to see the locations.

- H611-032: File Dependencies plug-in fails
  Problem:    If you active the filedeps.py plugin, you see a new menu
              /Navigate/Show File Dependency Path. However, this menu will
              not work and report a python error
  Workaround: open the python console, and type the following command,
              replacing file names as appropriate:
              filedeps.print_dependency_path \
                (GPS.File ("file1"), GPS.File ("file2"))

- H606-009: Incorrect file loaded in debugger with extending project
  Problem:    If you are loading an extending project is GPS which does not
              explicitely overrides its parent's Main attribute, then an
              incorrect executable (the one from the parent project) will be
              loaded in the debugger
  Workaround: Define the Main attribute explicitely in the extending project.

- H604-001: Delay in scripts execution in batch mode
  Problem:    When launching GPS with the option "--load=<a script>", the
              script only gets executed after the end of all background tasks
              such as the loading of the entity database for the Smart
              Completion.
  Workaround: Disable the preferences/scripts that launch these background
              tasks (such as the Smart Completion).

- H602-007: Cannot write data into read-only files
  Problem:    GPS does not properly detect that a file is read-only.
              This prevents GPS from temporarily set the file to writable
              to save the content as it is supposed to happen.
  Workaround: Set manually the file to writable.

- H529-001: Separator for combo boxes not supported in XML files
  Problem:    If you defined a "separator" attribute for a <combo> switch
              in the XML files, that separator is ignored
  Workaround: None.

- H526-009: Subversion status not properly reported
  Problem:    The "Needs merge" status is reported as "Needs update" in the
              VCS Explorer.
  Workaround: Use Subversion from the command line to get proper status.

- H512-021: Visual Differences is slow
  Problem:    It can take a long time to compute Visual Differences (for
              instance through the menu Tools->Compare or through VCS queries.
  Workaround: Disable the computation of fine changes. This is done by
              setting the "Fine Change Color" preference to the same value as
              the "Change Color" preference, in the "Visual Diff" panel.

- H504-003: Subversion compare two revisions not working
  Problem:    The "Compare two revisions" VCS action is not working with
              Subversion. The action seems to be ignored and no error
              message is displayed.
  Workaround: Compare both versions from the command line.

- H427-004: Subversion head revisions log not displayed
  Problem:    In the VCS Subversion log output, the head revisions are not
              displayed if they correspond to changes not yet updated
              locally.
  Workaround: Do an update of the file before displaying the log.

- H415-015: Wrong file used when compiling a file with no project
  Problem:    When compiling a file which does not belong to the current
              project hierarchy and a file with the same basename exists
              in one of the projects, this file is compiled instead of
              generating an error message.
  Workaround: Make sure your files always belong to a project.

- H409-028: Fix the activity contextual menu with multiple selected files
  Problem:    When selecting multiple files on the VCS Explorer the
              activity oriented entries in the contextual menu where not
              always accurate. The menu "Commit as new Activity" or "Add to
              Activity" could be present even though a selected file was
              already in an activity. The menu "Remove from Activity" was
              not listed if the first selected file had no activity.
  Workaround: Select only files belonging to the same activity.

- H407-006: Confusion when editing scenario variables
  Problem:    The dialog used to edit a scenario variable appears
              confusing to some users, who expect that changing the Name
              will in fact select another existing variable. Documentation
              was updated, and the label in the dialog changed to "Rename to".
  Workaround: None needed.

- H327-025: No source directories displayed in the project explorer
  Problem:    When the project explorer hidden directories is empty
              all source directories are hidden in the project explorer.
  Workaround: Set the pattern to its default "^((\..+)|CVS)$" or do not
              filter the hidden directories (see option in project explorer
              contextual menu).

- H319-009 Coverage annotations missing in the editors
  Problem:    When querying the code coverage annotation on a source editor,
              no symbols appear in the margin to indicate which lines are
              covered and which lines are not.
  Workaround: The detailed information is present in the .gcov files and via
              tooltips.

- H316-002: Cannot remove multiple files from an activity using VCS Explorer
  Problem:    Files selected in the VCS Explorer cannot be removed from the
              activity.
  Workaround: Remove files using the VCS Activities explorer.

- H314-018: Cannot add a file into an activity
  Problem:    It is not possible to add a file into an activity using the
              Version Control contextual menu on the editor.
  Workaround: Use the VCS Explorer to add files into the activity.

- H312-026: Cannot display coverage information of C source files.
  Problem:    When trying to display a coverage report for a project containing
              C source files, the report does not contain all the source files
              of the project, and only one C file.
  Workaround: Load separately the coverage information of each Ada source file

- H311-032: Cannot close debugger multiple choice dialog under Windows
  Problem:    When debugging under Windows, and a multiple choice dialog is
              displayed (when e.g. putting a breakpoint on an overloaded
              function), the close button will not always work properly, and
              the underlying debugger may crash.
  Workaround: Use the 'cancel' choice and 'OK' button instead to close the
              dialog.

- H309-006: VCS revisions not properly updated
  Problem:    In some cases (when the VCS cache already contains
              revision information) the files statuses are not properly
              updated. For example after a commit, doing a Query status
              won't show the new revision number of the committed files.
  Workaround: Use the external VCS command to get the revision numbers.

- H307-006: Cannot add multiple files into an anonymous activity
  Problem:    When multiple files are selected in the VCS Explorer only
              the first selected file gets added into the anonymous
              activity when using the "Commit as new Activity" action.
  Workaround: Add each file individually.

- H227-011: ispell and isearch in floating windows
  Problem:    When you try to use one of the two plugins in a floating editor,
              the expected popup window is not displayed correctly. GPS might
              even crash depending on your environment.
  Workaround: Unfloat the editor before using these plugins

- H225-011: Closing a floating assembly view crashes GPS
  Problem:    Closing the assembly view after the debug session has been
              terminated may crash GPS if the assembly view was in floating
              mode.
  Workaround: Be sure to close the assembly view before terminating the debug
              session or unfloat it before closing it.

- H225-023: Cannot displaying anonymous structures from g++ 4.1
  Problem:    When trying to display an anonymous structure generated by
              a g++ compiler there is an extra dotted name (ie .1) confusing
              GPS.
  Workaround: Use the 'print' contextual menu to display the values in the
              debugger console instead.

- H222-027: Duplicate -gnaty in project after editing properties
  Problem:    In some cases, in particular when you are using -gnaty<digit>,
              the resulting project file has duplicate entries for -gnaty
              switches. In addition, this results in extra case statements
              generated in the project.
  Workaround: Edit the project manually.

- H222-027: Editing project properties changes casing in project name
  Problem:    If you edit the properties of a project, the casing of its name
              might be changed (words are capitalized, and any specific casing
              you previously had is lost).
  Workaround: Projects are really case insensitive, so this issue only affects
              you if you are also editing projects manually. In such a case,
              you will need to overwrite GPS change.

- H218-005: Exception in dispatching.py plug-in when closing buffers
  Problem:    If you have activated the dispatching.py plug-in (which highlights
              dispatching calls in Ada code), and close a buffer just after you
              open it, an error message is displayed in the Messages window.
  Workaround: Wait a while before closing the buffer (so that all highlighting
              is done). You can also simply ignore the error message, which has
              no side effect.

- H207-009: Infinite loop when computing the Dispatching Calls menu
  Problem:    In some cases, GPS might end up in an infinite loop when
              computing the list of entities that could possibly be called
              from a dispatching call.
  Workaround: The problem seems to appear mostly on simple projects. If that
              is a frequent issue to you, you can disable the dispatching call
              search by changing the preference "Submenu for dispatching calls"

- H204-015: Project files variable references on external default not supported
  Problem:    A project file using a variable reference to specify an
              external default value was not loaded properly.
  Workaround: Specify the default value as a literal string.

- H201-015: Crash when launching an external command producing lots of output
  Problem:    When GPS launches an external command defined through an
              <external> XML tag, for instance in custom scripts or predefined
              plugins such as the Metrics plugin, GPS might run out of memory
              and crash if the command launched produces a very large amount of
              output.
  Workaround: Make sure that the commands launched do not produce huge output.
              If needed, use a wrapper around the tool that will strip extra
              output and call this wrapper from GPS instead of directly the
              tool.

- H129-003: Tooltip not properly displayed
  Problem:    It sometimes appears that a tooltip does not contain the name
              of the underlying entity and a GTK+ warning might be emitted.
  Workaround: Close the tooltip and display it again.

- H124-016: Last long word not displayed in the memory view
  Problem:    Depending on the first address specified in the memory view and
              from which memory is read, the last long word might not be
              displayed and replaced with dashes instead.
  Workaround: Adjust the address from which memory is read or use the x/ command
              of GDB directly.

- H122-026: Changing Ada switches for a file does not work
  Problem:    When using the switches editor to change the switches associated
              with a particular file, changes are not taken into account and
              might lead to unexpected behaviors.
  Workaround: Specify the swithes directly in the project file.

- H117-021: Crash when expanding nodes in the Project Explorer
  Problem:    After checking or unchecking items in the Project Explorer
              contextual menu, GPS might crash or show unexpected
              behavior after expanding or collapsing nodes.
  Workaround: Restart GPS after having checked/unchecked items in the
              contextual menu.

- H115-022: Directories without source not hidden
  Problem:    Directories containing no source file are not hidden in the
              Project Explorer even-though the hidden directory pattern
              would match.
  Workaround: Edit the project file to remove the directories you want to
              hide.

- H108-001: Issues with floating windows.
  Problem:    GPS might hang upon starting if there is more than one floating
              window in the stored desktop.
  Workaround: Remove the file "desktop.xml" in the .gps directory.

- H103-004: Revisions not properly highlighted
  Problem:    When clicking on the revision links on annotated files, the
              corresponding revision is not highlighted if the revision is
              already  present in the Revision View.
  Workaround: Close the Revision View before clicking on the version links.

- GC19-004: "Debug->Interrupt" not working in remote mode when using rsh
  Problem:    When debugging a program in remote mode, using rsh, using
              "Interrupt" has no effect.
  Workaround: Use ssh instead.

- GC17-004: Editing project reverses the order of packages
  Problem:    When you edit a project that contains several packages, GPS
              reverts the order of the packages in the resulting file,
              instead of preserving it.
  Workaround: Edit the project a second time

- GC13-020: Option --debug looking for executables in PATH
  Problem:    When launching GPS with the option "--debug=executable", looks
              for executable in the PATH, instead of looking in the current
              directory first.
  Workaround: Specify the full path to the executable.

- GC07-025: Ouline View can't display large profile
  Problem:    Routines with a large profile (more than 50 parameters)
              won't be properly output in the outline view.
  Workaround: Disable the output of the routine profile.

- GC04-018: GPS not compatible with firefox 1.5
  Problem:    GPS is not compatible with firefox 1.5, which does not support
              the -new-tab switch. When you select an entry in the /Help menu,
              firefox is open but the file is not visible
  Workaround: copy-paste the URL from the GPS Messages window into the location
              bar in firefox

- GB20-003: VCS not properly detected for subprojects
  Problem:    When using a hierarchy of projects, if a subproject has a VCS set
              but the root project does not have a VCS set, GPS is unable to
              call VCS operations on sources belonging to the subproject.
  Workaround: Set a VCS on the root project.

- GA26-033: Start/Continue button restarts the program when in remote mode
  Problem:    When using GPS to debug a program using the "remote" protocol,
              the first push on the Start/Continue button causes the program
              to be restarted, instead of continuing the execution.
  Workaround: Type "cont" in the debugger console instead of pressing the
              Start/Continue button.

- G906-021: Auto fixing doesn't indent correctly "pragma Unreferenced"
  Problem:    When GPS insert a "pragma Unreferenced" to fix an unreferenced
              entity warning, the indentation of the pragma may be incorrect.
  Workaround: Manually fix the indentation.

- G621-018: Auto fixing cannot remove variables containing "is"
  Problem:    When a variable type or initialization contains the string "is",
              and is not referenced, the auto fix proposed by GPS doesn't
              manage to remove it properly.
  Workaround: Remove manually the variable.

- FA23-004: Mischosen "from" as parameter name in the python API
  Problem:    "from" had been chosen as a parameter name of several methods of
              the GPS.EditorBuffer class. As a result, it was not possible to
              use named parameters for these methods as "from" is a python
              keyword. It has been replaced with "frm".
  Workaround: Do not use named parameters for methods that have a formal
              parameter named "from".

- F427-020: GPS slow when displaying some text files
  Problem:    When editing some text files such as .texi files, GPS is
              sometimes very slow when inserting new characters.
  Workaround: Disable the synx higlighting by setting another language
              for the file.

- E721-004: Lines cannot be removed after removing blank lines
  Problem:    When an editor has "blank lines" (for instance when the editor
              is part of a visual comparison), after these blank lines are
              removed, some line breaks might be left read-only, making it
              impossible to remove it using the backspace/delete keys.
  Workaround: Close the editor and reopen it.

- E703-001: Empty revision log when multiple files selected
  Problem:    It is possible to have an empty revision log when
              committing multiple files selected on the VCS Explorer.
  Workaround: Commit one file at a time or use an activity

- D502-003: Procedure name too long and overlap with VCS status
  Problem:    On the editor's status bar if a procedure name is
              too long it will overlap with the VCS status.
  Workaround: Use the VCS Explorer which displays the proper status
