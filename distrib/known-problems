Known Problems fixed in GPS 3.1.0

- E920-001 GPS installation conflicts with GtkAda installation
  Problem:    Both these tools install libgtkada.so on Unix platforms. If their
              version do not match, there might be conflicts either when
              running GPS or when compiling GtkAda applications
  Workaround: Install GPS in a separate directory

- E915-005 Version Control -> compare between two revisions doesn't work
  Problem:    The Version Control action to query a difference between two
              revisions of a file always returns "no differences found",
              without prompting a dialog to input the two revisions.
  Workaround: Query the differences using the command-line

- E911-003 gps - exception raised in codefix under windows
  Problem:    Under windows, applying a codefix leads to a constraint error.
  Workaround: Apply the fix manually

- E908-013 Bad indentation of "procedure xxx is null" construct
  Problem:    When parsing the Ada 2005 construct "procedure xxx is null;"
              GPS will incorrectly add an extra level of indentation
  Workaround: Fix the indentation by hand, or avoid this construct

- E908-004 Mouse button unresponsive on "File changed on disk" dialog
  Problem:    Under some circumstances, when files are changed on the disk,
              when switching editors by clicking on their notebook tabs, the
              buttons on the "File changed on disk" dialog do not respond to
              mouse click.
  Workaround: Use the keyboard to activate the buttons (Tab to select, Enter
              to activate)

- E831-001 Replace does not work on multiple-line searches
  Problem:    When using Search/Replace on a multiple-line search pattern, the
              "Replace" button does not cause the selected match to be
              overwritten.
  Workaround: Replace manually, using copy-paste for example

- E822-004 Bad indentation of arrows in case of nested parentheses
  Problem:    When using the "align association on arrows" preference and
              indenting a complex expression with multiple parentheses, GPS
              will sometimes wrongly align the arrows.
  Workaround: Disable the "align association on arrows" preference

- E727-022 Right-click in single-line selection cancels it
  Problem:    If you have selected part of a line, and right-click in it to
              display the contextual menu, the selection is cancelled. As a
              result, the action can no longer rely on the selection (for
              instance if you have put Copy/Paste/Cut in the contexual menu).

- E708-005 International characters converted to local character set when saving
  Problem:    When saving files, GPS ignores the preference in Character Set
              and saves to the local character set.
  Workaround: Set the environment variable CHARSET to your preferred character
              set (for example UTF-8)

- E708-004 Find Referemces... dialog returning unexpected references
  Problem:    The Find References... contextual menu opens a contextual menu
              where you can choose what kind of references should be returned.
              However, it happens that GPS returns other kinds in addition.
  Workaround: Ignore the other types (since the kind is listed in the Locations
              window)

- E701-005 Crash/Freeze when closing a New View of an editor
  Problem:    When using multiple views of an editor, if the original view
              is closed before any of the other views, GPS might become
              unstable when closing the other views.
  Workaround: Always close the new views before closing the original view

- E617-006 Casing problem in the executable name when editing projects
  Problem:    If you use file names with upper cases in your project, GPS will
              convert these names to lower case in the project file when you
              specify an executable name for this main unit.
  Workaround: manually edit your project file, or edit projects.xml to specify
              that the index is case sensitive for "executable"

- E606-010 GPS is unable to read files from disk after a long period
  Problem:    In a project that contains a lot of C/C++ files, or when working
              extensively with C/C++ files, GPS is unable to open new files.
  Workaround: Close GPS and restart

- E606-009 Local_Pragma_File project property always saved as a base file name
  Problem:    When you edit the project properties, the location of the pragma
              file is always saved as a base name, instead of a relative or
              absolute path.
  Workaround: Edit projects.xml in the GPS installation to remove the
              base_file_name attribute

- E525-012 Pasting in the consoles
  Problem:    When using the system-defined method for pasting the clipboard
              (ie ctrl-v under Windows, or middle-button press under Unix) in
              the GPS consoles, the text is always appended at the end of the
              line.
  Workaround: Use the menu Edit->Paste or its associated key binding

- E523-021 Bad block highlighting on accept statement
  Problem:    GPS will incorrectly display the current block for an accept
              statement, starting at the 'do' keyword instead of starting
              at the 'accept' keyword
  Workaround: This is only a visual glitch that can be ignored. Indentation
              will not be affected

- E308-016 Cannot initialize debugger under Tru64
  Problem:    In some cases, when initializing the debugger under Tru64,
              an error message is displayed in the debugger console such as:
              /dev/ptyrd: No such file or directory.
              /proc/380269: No such file or directory.
  Workaround: Disable the "Execution Window" preference in the Debugger section
