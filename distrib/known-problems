Known Problems fixed in GPS 6.0.0 / GNATbench 2.8.0

- LB21-035: GPS: wrong &lt char in locations
  Problem:    In Location View text created through scripting API has
              escaped markup characters.
  Workaround: None.

- LB21-021: GPS: Navigation problem in goto type declaration
  Problem:    The functionality of "Goto type declaration" moves the cursor
              to the location of the object declaration instead of moving
              it to the location of the type declaration.

  Workaround: Use "Goto type declaration" twice: the first one to move the
              cursor to the location of the object declaration and repeat it
              to move the cursor to the declaration of the corresponding type.

- LB14-054: GPS: keyboard shortcuts not functional when Caps Lock is active
  Problem:    When Caps Lock is active, letter-based keyboard shortcuts for
              GPS actions do not work.
  Workaround: Create a wrapper action, bound to the capitalized version of the
              letter.

- LB13-012: GPS: The contextual menu to close other editors has been removed
  Problem:    The contextual menu appearing on notebook tabs to close other
              editors has been removed.
  Workaround: Use the menu File -> Close All Editors Except Current instead.

- LA23-019: Bad indentation of access procedure type in generic declaration
  Problem:    When indenting code of the form:
              generic
                 type T is access procedure;
              The indentation engine gets confused and wrongly indents the
              following statements.
  Workaround: Fix the indentation manually.

- LA12-034: GPS: wrong menu for target with custom name in extending project
  Problem:    When using an extending project which defines an executable name
              for a main which is defined in the extended project, GPS does not
              display the custom name in the "Run" menu, and the corresponding
              target cannot be launched through the menu or the toolbar button.
  Workaround: Use the Build->Run->Custom... menu

- LA11-026: GPS: C/C++ completion of entities defined in header files
  Problem:    GPS does not propose a list of entities for completion when the
              type of the prefix is defined in a header file.

  Workaround: Include manually the file.

- LA11-003: No xref from separate units compiled explicitly
  Problem:    If you use separate Ada units, and compile them explicitly from
              the editor (for instance /Build/Compile File), then no
              cross-reference is available anymore for that file.
  Workaround: force the loading of all xref in memory, through
              /Build/Load Xref In Memory.
