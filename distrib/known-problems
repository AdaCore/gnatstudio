Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.0.1

- Deleting scenario variables sometimes generates an incorrect project
  Problem:    When clicking on the trash button next to a scenario variable
              (at the top of the project explorer), this will sometimes
              report an internal error.
  Workaround: Try setting other values for the variable before removing it.
              Last chance is to edit the project by hand, or keep the variable
              around, but always modify all the possible values in the project
              properties editor.

Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.0.0

- Tooltip displayed outside the source editor
  Problem:    When an editor has the focus, a tooltip may be displayed, even
              if the mouse is outside the editor area.
  Workaround: Click on another window or move the mouse to make the tooltip
              disappear

- Cursor no longer hidden under Windows
  Problem:    Under Windows, the mouse cursor sometimes disappears (e.g in the
              help window).
  Workaround: Moving the mouse will make it reappear.

- IDE project attributes not taken into account
  Problem:    When setting values for the compiler or debugger, GPS will not
              take them into account when building or debugging.
  Workaround: Use a wrapper script called gnatmake (or gdb) that calls the
              proper tool (e.g powerpc-wrs-vxworks-gnatmake).
