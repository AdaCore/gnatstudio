Known Problems fixed in GPS 5.2.0 / GNATbench 2.7.0

- L325-001: GPS: Refill requires an extra undo
  Problem:    After a Refill operation (menu Edit->Selection->Refill, shortcut
              Ctrl+=), GPS requires two "Undo" to revert the refill.
  Workaround: Perform the extra undo manually.

- L323-022: GPS: Scrolling occurs in Project View when reloading project
  Problem:    When reloading the project, the Project View might scroll.
              This can be cumbersome if, for instance, you are using the
              Project View to add files to an extending project.
  Workaround: Scroll manually.

- L321-021: GPS: Refactoring read-only files shows dialog with duplicates
  Problem:    If you do a refactoring that involves a read-only file and
              you haven't selected the "Make writable" option, a dialog
              is displayed that indicates which file will not be modified.
              But a file might be listed several times (for instance when
              renaming an entity that has multiple references in the file)
  Workaround: This is a visual glitch only.

- L321-020: GPS: Refactoring "Name parameters" requires an extra undo
  Problem:    After a refactoring "Name parameters" operation, GPS requires
              two "Undo" to revert the refactoring.
  Workaround: Perform the extra undo manually.

- L306-045: Project editor issue with gnat warnings switches
  Problem:    Default warnings, appearing greyed out when editing the
              switches in the project editor, cannot be turned off when
              clearing the button.
  Workaround: Disable all warnings with -gnatws, then activate only the
              warnings you want.

- L301-025: GPS: Current editor performing automatic undo after refactoring
  Problem:    When attempting a refactoring through the menu Refactoring ->
              Rename <name of entity>, if the entity information is not
              up-to-date, pressing "Undo" in the confirmation dialog risks
              causing the current editor to "Undo" more than once.
  Workaround: After choosing "Undo" on the confirmation dialog, verify the
              state of the current editor, and press "Redo" as necessary.

- L215-043: GPS: expanded code not working in remote mode
  Problem:    When configured with a remote build server, the "expanded code"
              actions are still trying to use the local host's toolchain even
              when it's not available.
  Workaround: Manually generate the .dg file and copy it locally before
              executing the command, or install a local toolchain.

- L215-011: GPS: navigating causes automatic reloads
  Problem:    When using GPS to navigate through the code, for instance with
              the "Goto declaration of" menu, if the target editor is already
              open but has been modified outside of GPS, then it will be
              reloaded from disk without prompting the user first.
  Workaround: Avoid editing files outside of GPS.

- L213-022: GPS: tip-of-the-day hides modal dialogs
  Problem:    When opening GPS, if a modal dialog is brought up immediately
              after the main window (for instance when using the key shortcuts
              to launch a custom build), the tip-of-the-day window appears over
              the dialog, making it difficult to close.
  Workaround: Press ESC to close the dialog.

- L213-003: GPS: emacs plugin's ctrl-o does not work
  Problem:    When you load the Emacs plugin, it binds the key ctrl-o to
              "open line". The implementation for this function had a bug,
              and nothing was changed in the editor when pressing ctrl-o.
  Workaround: Press <enter> and <left arrow> will have the same result.

- L202-022: GPS: visual glitches when the Breakpoints editor is too small
  Problem:    When the Breakpoints editor is too small, there is a visual
              overlap in the display of its contents.
  Workaround: Resize, move, or float the Breakpoints editor.

- L131-031: GPS: jump to the current location when opening the search dialog
  Problem:    When the cursor in an editor is outside of the visible area,
              opening the Search dialog will cause the editor to scroll to
              show the position of the cursor.
  Workaround: Scroll manually, or position the cursor before opening the
              search dialog.

- L124-025: GPS: plugin highlight_selection.py is slow on large files
  Problem:    When activating the plugin highlight_selection.py, GPS might be
              slow to react to a selection on editors for large files.
  Workaround: Deactivate highlight_selection.py

- L123-032: GPS: Editing Library Interface in Project Properties
  Problem:    The project attribute Library_Interface must contain unit names.
              However, GPS will set it using file names instead, and as a
              result the compiler complains.
  Workaround: Edit the project manually (*.gpr).

- L123-031: GPS: Project editor discards the Executable attribute
  Problem:    On Windows, when a project contains the "Executable" attribute
              to specify an explicit file name for the executable generated
              from a main unit, and the casing in the index isn't lower cases,
              the attribute is discarded every time the project is edited.
  Workaround: Fix the casing manually in the .gpr file to use lower cases
              only.

- KC20-025: GPS: Removing a server makes some other servers unuseable
  Problem:    After removing a server from your server list, the other servers
              using the same shell or remote access tool become unuseable.
  Workaround: Remove the server manually from the .gps/remote.xml file.

- KC12-009: Find All References missing refs with extending projects
  Problem:    When searching for all references from a file in an extending
              project, GPS fails to report the references that are in files
              that are in other non-extending projects.
  Workaround: Manually load all Xref information via the /Build menu.

- KC01-011: GPS: Show Entity <package> shows subprogram parameters
  Problem:    If you select the contextual menu Browsers/Show Entity for
              a package, the resulting box contains the parameters of the
              subprograms. The solution involves changes in GPS but also
              requires a version of GNAT more recent than 2012-02-08.
  Workaround: None.

- KA27-009: GPS: unwanted scrolling when canceling interactive search
  Problem:    When using the interactive search (plugin isearch.py), if the
              cursor is outside of the visible area, clicking on the editor
              to replace the cursor will cause unwanted scrolling.
  Workaround: Scroll back manually after the unwanted scrolling.

- KA04-024: GPS: wrong column highlighted for label:begin
  Problem:    When GPS highlights the current block which starts with a
              label followed by the begin keyword, the wrong column is used
              to highlight the block.
  Workaround: Disable block highlighting or ignore this visual glitch.

- K930-020: Recursive project source dirs and Windows host
  Problem:    When GPS is running on a Windows host, but driving a Unix
              build server, and the user edits the project to use recursive
              subdirectories, the syntax generated in the project file is
              Windows specific and rejected by the build server.
  Workaround: Edit the project manually to replace "\**" with "/**".

- K930-009: GB: Search view double clicking on Ada references exceptions
  Problem:    In some cases, when double clicking on an Ada reference from the
              Search view, the ada file is opened but the cursor is not moved
              to the reference.
  Workaround: Retry the Ada references search process.

- K926-014: GB: GNATbench freezes when viewing/editing Ada files
  Problem:    Randomly when using the GNATbench Ada editor for code edition
              or program debug, GNATbench freezes. The only solution to get
              rid of the lock is to kill GNATbench, and launch it back.
  Workaround: - Run menu Window => Preferences
              - Open Ada => Editor preferences page
              - Disable the 3 following features
                1- Tooltips should be displayed automatically.
                2- Enable Code Assist.
                3- Enable Code Assist auto activation.

- K804-029: GPS: cannot bind Tab key to menus and use it to navigate
  Problem:    When assigning the Tab key to a menu, for instance
              /Edit/Format Selection, it is not possible to use the Tab key
              to navigate in the non-modal dialogs such as the Search dialog.
  Workaround: Use another key shortcut, or bind the Tab key to the
              corresponding action if it exists (for instance the action
              "Format Selection" in the "Editor" section in the Key Shortcuts
              view).

- K325-019: GPS: autofix for lines containing only spaces
  Problem:    The autofix for blanks at end of line removes the whole line if
              the line is composed only by spaces.
  Workaround: Do not use autofix on such lines or replace manually the removed
              line by an empty line.

- L113-025: GPS: cursor at wrong position after alias expansion
  Problem:    When alias text contains multibyte UTF-8 characters cursor is
              placed at wrong position after expansion.
  Workaround: Do not use multibyte UTF-8 characters in text of an alias.

- F816-013: GPS: Highlighting for comments in C with international characters
  Problem:    GPS does not properly compute the syntax coloring for comments
              which contain international characters in C sources.
  Workaround: No workaround.
