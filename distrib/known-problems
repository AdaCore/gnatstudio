Known Problems fixed in GPS 3.2.0

- EC28-009 GPS under Windows leaks some handles
  Problem:    On Windows GPS leaks one file handle, one process handle and one
              thread handle for each external command launched. This can lead
              to some instabilities after a long run.
  Workaround: Restart GPS from time to time

- EC07-015 Sorting Ascending/Descending problem with empty selection
  Problem:    Where there is no line selected the commands Sort Ascending and
              Sort Descending are not working properly. In this case, the sort
              should do nothing instead of swapping some characters.
  Workaround: Sort the lines manually

- EC07-009 Leave focus on selected window in the bookmarks view
  Problem:    When you select an existing bookmark in the bookmarks view, the
              focus remains on the bookmark view instead of going to the
              associated editor.
  Workaround: Select the bookmark and then the editor

- EB22-005 Reset switches for a file to default leaves the attribute in project
  Problem:    If you open the Project->Edit File Switches, and reset the
              switches for one of the files to the default value, an entry is
              still left in the project file. Further changes to the default
              switches are not reflected for this file
  Workaround: Edit the project file manually
