Known Problems fixed in GPS 2.1.0

- DA27-002 Detection of external changes only when timestamp is more recent
  Problem:    If you modify a file with an other editor than GPS, or through
              a version control system, GPS will only detect changes to that
              file if its new timestamp is earlier than before.
  Workaround: "touch" the file, or save again with an editor

- DA19-018 Casing not preserved for object and exec directories
  Problem:    In the project view (and in the result of current_context() in
              scripting languages), the object and exec directory names are
              converted to lower-cases on case-insensitive file systems
  Workaround: None for the project view, but in shell you can do a "cd" to
              that directory and getcwd() to read with the right casing.

- DA15-003 XML files: action not found when defined outside of theme
  Problem:    If a theme defines a menu which references an action defined
              outside of <theme>, the action is reported as not found
  Workaround: Define the action inside the <theme>, or at least a new action
              that just executes the first one through a call to the shell
              command GPS.execute_action.

- DA11-015 The auto-saved files can confuse some building mechanisms
  Problem:    When GPS is configured to automatically save the contents of the
              editors, the files created have the same extension as the
              original files, and this might be a problem in some building
              environment.
  Workaround: Remove all auto-saves before building

- DA11-007 Cross-references failing on Windows
  Problem:    In some cases, depending for instance on how and at what point
              the project file was loaded, the cross-references might fail
              on Windows (the contextual menu doesn't show the xref items).
  Workaround: Reload the file differently, e.g. using File->Open From Project

- DA10-004 Crash in "Find all local refs"
  Problem:    GPS sometimes crashes when calling the Find all locals
              refs contextual menu.
  Workaround: Use "Find all refs" instead

- When using CVS, operation "Query status for directory" is recursive
  Problem:    When using CVS, the operation "Query status for directory"
              the status for files in the sub-directories as well.
  Workaround: Prefer the use of "Query status for project"

- DA05-024 In VCS XML definitions, <diff_working> node has no effect
  Problem:    When writing or modifying XML files for supporting a new VCS,
              the <diff_working> node has no effect.
  Workaround: Create a contextual menu item specifically for this effect

- D920-004 The bottom of files may get corrupted when using block folding
  Problem:    When using block folding, GPS may change the order or corrupt the
              last lines in the file.
  Workaround: Do not use block folding

- Search misses occurrences in sources with tabs
  Problem:    The search tool will miss some occurrences if your source file
              contains tabs.
  Workaround: Do a search for all occurrences, and then click in the
              location window.

- Custom toolbar buttons are not shown when created through parse_xml
  Problem:    If you use the GPS shell command "parse_xml" to create toolbar
              buttons, those buttons are not displayed.
  Workaround: Use the XML files mechanism to create toolbar buttons

- D914-023 Sort order in Project View now kept when scenario changes
  Problem:    If you change the value of the environment variables that
              describe the current scenario, the list of directories in the
              project view will change appropriately, but the new directories
              are appended at the end, instead of keeping the sort order.
  Workaround: Close and reopen the project view to force a refresh

- D914-015 MDI docks size incorrectly restored when loading desktop
  Problem:    When a desktop file is read, the size of the docks (on each
              side of the main GPS window) is incorrectly restored
  Workaround: Resize them manually by drag-and-dropping the separator

- Directories in Project View contain no file after a change of scenario
  Problem:    If you select a new value for the scenario variables at the
              top of the project view, the directories that didn't exist
              in the previous scenario are correctly added, but contain
              no visible file
  Workaround: Close the project node, select again the scenario, and reopen
              the project node to force an update.

- D902-016 Project wizard print a warning if the directory contains a dot
  Problem:    If you use the project wizard to create a new project in
              a directory that contains a dot ('.'), GPS will display a
              warning about child projects.
  Workaround: This warning can be safely ignored

- D831-003 Ada runtime files not seen as direct sources of a project
  Problem:    If a project has one or more files with the same name as the
              Ada runtime, these files will not be displayed in the Project
              View, and cannot be open through the "Open From Project" menu
  Workaround: Edit the file with File->Open. This doesn't impact the build
              mechanism.

- D817-008 Closing the Run window does not always terminate execution.
  Problem:    In particular under Windows, and with multi-threaded programs,
              closing the Run window does not terminate the execution.
  Workaround: Terminate the program using "kill" (under UNIX) or the Windows
              task manager.

- D816-007 Double-clicking does not select identifiers containing digits
  Problem:    When an identifier contain digits, double-clicking on it does not
              select the entire word.
  Workaround: Select the identifier manually

- D806-007 Selecting text and pressing enter does not delete the selection
  Problem:    When there is a selection in an editor that has auto-indentation
              capabilities, the text is not deleted when pressing enter.
  Workaround: Delete the text by pressing the <delete> key

- D804-011 Focus switch leaves the editors in interactive selection mode
  Problem:    When selecting text in editors using the mouse, if an external
              window grabs the focus, the editor is stuck in selection mode and
              GPS might crash when closing this editor.
  Workaround: There is no workaround for this problem

- D803-001 It is possible to set breakpoints on lines with no code
  Problem:    When the debugger preference "Show lines with code" is enabled,
              it is still possible to set breakpoints on lines that do not
              contain code.
  Workaround: This behavior is harmless. The meaning of a breakpoint on a line
              with no code is that it is set on the first line containing code
              after this line

- D802-017 GPS scrolls back to line 1 when opening an already opened file
  Problem:    If you double-click on a file name in the explorer (or
              select it in the Open From Project menu), and the file is
              already opened, GPS will show the file but scroll back to
              line 1
  Workaround: Select the file through the Window menu

- D721-004 Typing in floating read-only editors writes in other editors
  Problem:    When you type characters in a read-only floating editor, the
              actual editing might occur in a non-floating editor instead.
  Workaround: Do not type in read-only floating editors

- D715-006 Drag-and-drop a window on another floating window fails
  Problem:    If you are trying to make a window floating by dragging it
              and dropping over an already floating window, GPS will in
              fact put the new window in one of its docks instead of
              floating it.
  Workaround: Drop the window outside any GPS window, floating or not

- D707-010 In the Locations View, line numbers are hard to read
  Problem:     On the currently selected line in the locations view, the line
               and column number are written in black on a dark blue background
               and are therefore hard to read.
  Workaround:  Select another line or give the focus to another component

- D615-009 References highlighting is confused by TABs
  Problem     When navigating through search results in the Locations view,
              the highlighting is wrong on lines that contain TABs before the
              reference.
  Workaround: Convert TABs into spaces

- D515-001 "Tasks are running" window shows internal processings of GPS
  Problem:    When launching GPS and exiting quickly, or when exiting right
              after opening a new editor, GPS opens the "Tasks are running"
              window and shows internal GPS commands.
  Workaround: These messages can safely be ignored

- Using "Locate in explorer" from VCS Explorer doesn't work
  Problem:    When using the contextual menu on an entry in the VCS Explorer
              and using "Locate in Explorer: ...", nothing happens.
  Workaround: Double-click on the entry to open the file, and use "Locate in
              explorer" on the file editor.

- Changing size of a font resets its color
  Problem:    In the preferences dialog, changing the size of a font resets
              its foreground and background colors to the default values.
  Workaround: Set the color again explicitely

- D614-009 Errors in C files are not displayed in the Locations window
  Problem:    Under Windows, the errors produced by compilation of C files are
              not visible in the Locations window.
  Workaround: Open the Preferences, in the "Messages" section, and change the
              "File pattern" entry to
                 "^([^:]:?[^:]*):(\d+):((\d+):)? ((warning)?(\(style)?.*)".

- D531-001 Over alignment of variable declarations
  Problem:    When aligning the colon (':') character in variable declarations,
              the computation is not stopped when encountering a blank line.
  Workaround: Indent manually when needed

- CC24-001 Font dialog incorrectly initialized in preferences dialog
  Problem:    When editing fonts through the Edit->Preferences dialog, the
              font dialog that pops up always has "sans 10" selected initially,
              instead of the current font
  Workaround: Select manually the font you want to use

- CB30-002 Wrong behavior when double-clicking on the tab
  Problem:    When double-clicking on the tab the windows get properly resized
              only if there is more than 2 files opened.
  Workaround: Use "Window" -> "Unmaximize All" instead
