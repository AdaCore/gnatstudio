- F612-025 VCS not passing full pathnames
  Problem:    When Absolute_Names is set to True the VCS actions are not
              receiving the full pathname for the file to handle.
  Workaround: No known workaround

- F612-010 Line number not refreshed after "Go to line"
  Problem:    If you change the current line in editor with the "Go to line"
              dialog, the line number is not refreshed in the editor's status
              bar until you move the cursor
  Workaround: Move the cursor one character to the left or right to force a
              refresh
