Known Problems fixed in GPS 3.1.0

- E525-012 Pasting in the consoles
  Problem:    When using the system-defined method for pasting the clipboard
              (ie ctrl-v under Windows, or middle-button press under Unix) in
              the GPS consoles, the text is always appended at the end of the
              line.
  Workaround: Use the menu Edit->Paste or its associated key binding.

- E516-016 Problem with project dependencies browser
  Problem:    A Constraint Error is raised when asking for a project
              dependencies on the depency graph after this project dependency
              with the root project has been removed.

- E512-009 Search does not work in untitled window
  Problem:    Performing a "Current File" search does not work when the current
              file is a new file not yet saved on disk. The action is actually
              performed on the last opened editor whose file exists on disk
              (if any).

- E525-008 Endless query for password when using remote files
  Problem:    If you enter an incorrect user name or press cancel in the dialog
              when accessing a remote file, GPS will keep asking for your
              password, preventing you from doing anything else
  Workaround: Kill GPS

- E308-016 Cannot initialize debugger under Tru64
  Problem:    In some cases, when initializing the debugger under Tru64,
              an error message is displayed in the debugger console such as:
              /dev/ptyrd: No such file or directory.
              /proc/380269: No such file or directory.
  Workaround: Disable the "Execution Window" preference in the Debugger section
