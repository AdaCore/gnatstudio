Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.3.0

- C501-004 Incorrect naming scheme when saving new Ada file
  Problem:    When you save a newly created Ada file, the suggested default
              name used the GNAT naming scheme (.adb and .ads), instead of
              the root project's
  Workaround: Override the default value with the proper name

- Incorrect placement of cursor after insertion of <return>
  Problem:    When auto-indentation is actived and one presses <return> in the
              middle of a line, the cursor ends up at the end of the second
              line instead of the beginning
  Workaround: Press <home> just after <return>

- C429-010 Automatic Uncomment Lines operations sometimes fail.
  Problem:    When uncommenting Ada lines that only contain "--", or lines
              starting with spaces, with less than two spaces after "--",
              the line is not uncommented.
  Workaround: Uncomment those lines manually.

- C425-019 Handling of projects with no supported language
  Problem:    If you create a project with no supported language (either through
              the project properties editor or manually by setting the
              Languages attribute to the empty list), GPS will show "Ada" as
              supported the next time the project properties editor is open
  Workaround: Edit such projects by hand

- gnat stub started with wrong project
  Problem:    When the menu Edit->Generate Body is selected, gnat stub fails
              executing because it cannot found the project
  Workaround: run gnat stub directly in a shell window

- C312-002 Code correction error with CR/LF files
  Problem:    When using automatic code correction with files containing CR/LF
              line terminators, the correction is wrong.
  Workaround: Save the files in "unix" mode

- Infinite loop in search dialog
  Problem:    In some cases, it might happen that looking for a constant string
              results in an infinite loop in GPS.
  Workaround: Click the Regexp button in the search dialog before starting the
              search

- Incorrect refresh of the project explorer when the project changes
  Problem:    If you change the project or the scenario variables, the project
              explorer's contents is refreshed, and all directories seem to
              contain files (there is a [+] on the left).
  Workaround: None needed, when you click on the +, it simply disappears.

- C326-004 Duplicate entries in dialog File->Open From Project
  Problem:    When using extending projects, duplicate source files might be
              displayed in this dialog (once for the original project and once
              for the extending project)
  Workaround: Click on any of the instance, they all point to the same file
