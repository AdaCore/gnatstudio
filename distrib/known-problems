Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.3.0

- Infinite loop in search dialog
  Problem:    In some cases, it might happen that looking for a constant string
              results in an infinite loop in GPS.
  Workaround: Click the Regexp button in the search dialog before starting the
              search

- Incorrect refresh of the project explorer when the project changes
  Problem:    If you change the project or the scenario variables, the project
              explorer's contents is refreshed, and all directories seem to
              contain files (there is a [+] on the left).
  Workaround: None needed, when you click on the +, it simply disappears.

- C326-004 Duplicate entries in dialog File->Open From Project
  Problem:    When using extending projects, duplicate source files might be
              displayed in this dialog (once for the original project and once
              for the extending project)
  Workaround: Click on any of the instance, they all point to the same file
