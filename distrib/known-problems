Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.2.1

- C424-012 Cancel button not working under Windows in 'Save As' dialog
  Problem:    When using the 'Save As' dialog under Windows, the cancel button
              button is ignored, saving unconditionally the file.
  Workaround: Avoid using the cancel button when using this dialog.

- C418-010 Messages window not saved in the desktop
  Problem:    When the desktop is saved, the location of the messages window
              is not saved.
  Workaround: It is possible to manually edit the file $HOME/.gps/desktop, but
              it is simpler to move the messages window back to the location
              where you want it on startup.
                                                                                
- C418-010 Incorrect desktop loading for location window
  Problem:    If the location window is put in the left dock, and the desktop
              is saved, then GPS won't be able to restore the desktop on startup              and will crash.
  Workaround: Edit the file $HOME/.gps/desktop by hand to remove the location
              window reference.

- C425-020 Selection in greyed out fields in the project properties editor
  Problem:    If Ada is not a supported language for your project, the combo
              boxes for the compiler and gnatls can still be selected by
              clicking on the arrow.
  Workaround: Avoid clicking on the arrow, although no arm will result if you
              do. The new setting is simply ignored when the project is saved.
                                                                                
- Extra dialog displayed during search
  Problem:    When starting a search from the beginning of a file, GPS will ask
              to restart from the beginning once the search reaches the end of
              the file and no occurrence is found.
  Workaround: Ignore the dialog.

- C428-027 Interactive Replace does not work.
  Problem:    When using the Search dialog to perform Replace operations on the
              current file, clicking the Replace button does not replace the
              text, but only skips to the next issue.
  Workaround: Use the "Replace all occurrences" mode.

- C422-016 Under Windows, the Directory Selection dialog raises error windows.
  Problem:    Under Windows, using the Directory Selection dialog might bring
              up error dialogs saying
                "There is no disk in the drive.
                 Please insert a disk into drive A:"
  Workaround: These errors can be safely ignored.

- C312-004 Under Windows, docking the Search dialog causes undesired resizing.
  Problem:    Under Windows only, when the Search dialog is docked and the
              main GPS window is maximized, pressing CTRL-F causes the GPS
              window to be un-maximized.
  Workaround: Do not maximize the GPS main window, make it manually as big
              as the desktop.

- C425-015 Tooltip flashing under Windows
  Problem:    Under Windows only, when you move the mouse on the menu
              Project->Recompute Project, a tooltip is displayed and
              immediately removed, continuousely.
  Workaround: Mouse the mouse to another menu item.

Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.2.0

- C404-010 Bad indentation of task specs in some cases
  Problem:    The indentation engine will not properly parse task specs in
              the following cases: the task spec contains a pragma taking
              parameters as its first non comment line, e.g:

              task T is
                 pragma Storage_Size (2000);
                 entry E;
              end T;

  Workaround: Move the pragma after other declarations (e.g. after 'entry E'
              in the example above).

- C318-002 "Find All References" Menu is not working.
  Problem:    The global menu "Navigate->Find All References" does nothing.
  Workaround: Use the contextual menu "References->Find All References to".

- C324-007 Error executing custom actions with constant arguments
  Problem:    If a command specified in the custom file (to add a new menu)
              contains an argument that doesn't start with '%', that command is
              improperly executed.
  Workaround: Create a small wrapper script that doesn't need this constant
              argument, and call that script instead

- C326-002 GPS crashes changing Unit size in Memory View
  Problem:    When using the GPS memory view, switching the Unit Size might
              cause GPS to crash.
  Workaround: Inspect the memory using the "x" command of gdb.

- C312-005 Reloading current project kills all open windows
  Problem:    If you reopen (Project->Open or Project->Recent) the currently
              loaded project, GPS asks for saving the windows, and then closes
              all of them to reload the desktop.
  Workaround: Load another project before reloading the project.

- C312-013 Problem building with relative paths under Windows
  Problem:    Under Windows, when using projects with relative pathnames,
              if you change the current drive (by e.g. opening a file in
              another drive), the build will not succeed.
  Workaround: Use absolute paths in your project file, or use the menu
              File->Change Directory... before doing a build.

- Callgraph missing references with extended projects
  Problem:    If your project hierarchy is setup so that A extends B, then
              a callgraph for an entity of A will miss all calls done from
              source files only in B, and not overriden in A.
  Workaround: None found.

- Only two desktops can be saved
  Problem:    If there are already two desktops saved, saving a new one
              replaces the oldest of the existing two desktops by the new one.
  Workaround: copy ~/.gps/desktop as needed, and put the right version back
              just before launching GPS.

- C228-015 Command Make "All main subprograms" fails on Windows
  Problem:    The command make "All main subprograms" fails on Windows. GPS
              just report immediately "process exited with status -1".
  Workaround: Build all main procedures separately.

- Missing occurrences in search
  Problem:    In some case, the search algorithm was missing some occurrences
              of the string in the files.
  Workaround: Search for a regular expression instead.

- C228-002 Changes in project settings not taken into account immediately
  Problem:    If you modify the compiler name in the project properties editor,
              it isn't taken into account for the following compilation commands
  Workaround: Quit GPS and reload the project

- C222-002 Problem with save as null extension under Windows
  Problem:    Under Windows platforms only, when creating a file with no
              extension, a default .ads extension is always added.
  Workaround: Create an empty file with the right name outside of GPS, and
              then load it and edit it in GPS.

- No GPS window when unknown project specified on the command line
  Problem:    If a non-existing project file is specified on the command line
              with the -P parameter, the GPS window didn't appear on the screen
  Workaround: Make sure the file exists when specified on the command line

- OK button not selected in the "Open From Project" dialog the second time
  Problem:    When the dialog File->Open From Project is displayed, pressing
              enter will automatically open the file. However, this no longer
              worked the second time.
  Workaround: Press Alt+O instead

- C227-001 Last line of file not saved properly
  Problem:    In some cases when saving a file, the last character is
              truncated.
  Workaround: Add an extra blank line at the end of the file before saving it.

- C218-012 Drive letters not supported under Windows
  Problem:    The drive letters are not properly supported in the directory
              selector.
  Workaround: Change the current directory the the desired drive before using
              the directory selector, or type the full path directly.

- C216-001 Inconsistent behavior when exiting with unsaved files
  Problem:    If you have modified files and exit GPS, a confirmation dialog
              asking whether the files should be saved is displayed. If you
              cancel this dialog, and later exit GPS again, no dialog will
              be displayed for saving the modified file, unless the file has
              been modified again since the last exit. Similarly, the 'All'
              button will not work.
  Workaround: Save the file explicitely, or use the menu File->Save...->All
              before exiting.

- C130-023 Crash when opening multiple new files
  Problem:    When opening new files using the menu File->New or the
              toolbar icon, opening multiple new files when the line numbers
              are displayed causes GPS to crash.
  Workaround: In the preferences dialog, disable the "Display line numbers"
              preference in the Editor section.

- C128-002 Crash when searching in files containing CR characters
  Problem:    When searching in a file containing CR with no corresponding
              LF characters, GPS sometimes crashes or behaves in an unreliable
              way.
  Workaround: Save the file as Unix or Windows format.

- C117-005 Crash when adding lines in new file
  Problem:    When editing a new file while the line numbers are displayed,
              adding a few lines will cause GPS to crash.
  Workaround: Disable the "Display line numbers" preference.

- C116-002 Current line highlighting sometimes highlights multiple lines.
  Problem:    In some cases, for example when Reverting a file from the disk,
              the color that is used to highlight the current line is visible
              on multiple lines.
  Workaround: Scroll the editor or move the cursor to remove the extra
              highlighting.

- C105-001 Mismatch between files and VCS logs.
  Problem:    In some cases, the VCS log files do not correspond to the right
              files, or GPS cannot read the mapping file, and therefore
              cannot start.
  Workaround: Remove all the files in the log_files subdirectory in the GPS
              directory.

- Bad handling of item icon when saving new file
  Problem:    After saving an untitled file, the icon corresponding to the
              editor still shows the "modified" icon.
  Workaround: Save the file twice.

- Extended project nodes duplicated in explorer when recomputing view
  Problem:    If your project hierarchy includes extended project, and you
              select the menu Project->Recompute View, the extended project
              nodes are duplicated, and the exec directories disappear
  Workaround: Reload the project through Project->Recent instead

- BC04-009 Annoying scrolling when switching tabs
  Problem:    When switching from an editor to another, the editors scroll
              back to the place where their cursor is set, not to the point
              that was viewed the most recently.
  Workaround: Set the cursor within the viewed area before switching.

- Inconsistency between debugger dot colors when showing lines with code
  Problem:    When the debugger preference "show lines with code" is set,
              unsetting a breakpoint will leave a blue dot.
  Workaround: Always enable the "show lines with code" preference.
