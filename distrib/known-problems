Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.3.0

- H207-009: Infinite loop when computing the Dispatching Calls menu
  Problem:    In some cases, GPS might end up in an infinite loop when
              computing the list of entities that could possibly be called
              from a dispatching call.
  Workaround: The problem seems to appear mostly on simple projects. If that
              is a frequent issue to you, you can disable the dispatching call
              search by changing the preference "Submenu for dispatching calls"

- H204-015: Project files variable references on external default not supported
  Problem:    A project file using a variable reference to specify an
              external default value was not loaded properly.
  Workaround: Specify the default value as a literal string.

- H201-015: Crashes when launching an external command
  Problem:    When GPS launches an external command defined through an
              <external> XML tag, for instance in custom scripts or predefined
              plugins such as the Metrics plugin, GPS might run out of memory
              and crash if the command launched produces a very large amount of
              output.
  Workaround: Make sure that the commands launched do not produce huge output.

- H129-003: Tooltip not properly displayed
  Problem:    It sometimes appears that a tooltip does not contain the name
              of the underlying entity and a GTK+ warning might be emitted.
  Workaround: Close the tooltip and display it again.

- H124-016: Last long word not displayed in the memory view
  Problem:    Depending on the first address specified in the memory view and
              from which memory is read, the last long word might not be
              displayed and replaced with dashes instead.
  Workaround: Adjust the address from which memory is read or use the x/ command
              of GDB directly.

- H122-026: Changing Ada switches for a file does not work
  Problem:    When using the switches editor to change the switches associated
              with a particular file, changes are not taken into account and
              might lead to unexpected behaviors.
  Workaround: Specify the swithes directly in the project file.

- H117-021: Crash when expanding nodes in the Project Explorer
  Problem:    After checking or unchecking items in the Project Explorer
              contextual menu, GPS might crash or show unexpected
              behavior after expanding or collapsing nodes.
  Workaround: Restart GPS after having checked/unchecked items in the
              contextual menu.

- H115-022: Directories without source not hidden
  Problem:    Directories containing no source file are not hidden in the
              Project Explorer even-though the hidden directory pattern
              would match.
  Workaround: Edit the project file to remove the directories you want to
              hide.

- H108-001: Issues with floating windows.
  Problem:    GPS might hang upon starting if there is more than one floating
              window in the stored desktop.
  Workaround: Remove the file "desktop.xml" in the .gps directory.

- H103-004: Revisions not properly highlighted
  Problem:    When clicking on the revision links on annotated files, the
              corresponding revision is not highlighted if the revision is
              already  present in the Revision View.
  Workaround: Close the Revision View before clicking on the version links.

- GC07-025: Ouline View can't display large profile
  Problem:    Routines with a large profile (more than 50 parameters)
              won't be properly output in the outline view.
  Workaround: Disable the output of the routine profile.

- GC04-018: GPS not compatible with firefox 1.5
  Problem:    GPS is not compatible with firefox 1.5, which does not support
              the -new-tab switch. When you select an entry in the /Help menu,
              firefox is open but the file is not visible
  Workaround: copy-paste the URL from the GPS Messages window into the location
              bar in firefox

- GB20-003: VCS not properly detected for subprojects
  Problem:    When using a hierarchy of projects, if a subproject has a VCS set
              but the root project does not have a VCS set, GPS is unable to
              call VCS operations on sources belonging to the subproject.
  Workaround: Set a VCS on the root project.

- GA26-033: Start/Continue button restarts the program when in remote mode
  Problem:    When using GPS to debug a program using the "remote" protocol,
              the first push on the Start/Continue button causes the program
              to be restarted, instead of continuing the execution.
  Workaround: Type "cont" in the debugger console instead of pressing the
              Start/Continue button.

- G906-021: Auto fixing doesn't indent correctly "pragma Unreferenced"
  Problem:    When GPS insert a "pragma Unreferenced" to fix an unreferenced
              entity warning, the indentation of the pragma may be incorrect.
  Workaround: Manually fix the indentation.

- G621-018: Auto fixing cannot remove variables containing "is"
  Problem:    When a variable type or initialization contains the string "is",
              and is not referenced, the auto fix proposed by GPS doesn't
              manage to remove it properly.
  Workaround: Remove manually the variable.

- FA23-004: Mischosen "from" as parameter name in the python API
  Problem:    "from" had been chosen as a parameter name of several methods of
              the GPS.EditorBuffer class. As a result, it was not possible to
              use named parameters for these methods as "from" is a python
              keyword. It has been replaced with "frm".
  Workaround: Do not use named parameters for methods that have a formal
              parameter named "from".
