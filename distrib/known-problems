Known Problems fixed in GPS 6.1.0 / GNATbench 2.9.0

- MB13-062: GPS: the key shortcuts are not display in some Build menus
  Problem:    The key shortcuts are not displayed in some menus that
              are present under the Build toplevel menu.
  Workaround: None.

- MB01-006: GPS: create_missing_dirs not working with trailing separators
  Problem:    The plugin create_missing_dirs.py does not create directories
              that are specified with a trailing directory separator.
  Workaround: Create the directories manually, or remove the directory
              separator at the end of the directory specification.

- JC07-006: GPS: rsh leaving remote processes as zombies in remote mode.
  Problem:    When using GPS remote mode with rsh, it may happen that spawned
              remote processes are not properly terminated before the rsh
              connection is closed.
              This may lead to zombie processes remaining on the remote host.
              rsh support by GPS has now been deprecated, as rsh is not an
              active development anymore, and has been replaced by secure and
              more robust solutions such as ssh.
  Workaround: Use ssh instead. If absolutely needed, you can re-enable rsh
              support by using the remote_rsh.py plugin, to be activated from
              the Tools->Plug-ins menu.

- G928-018: GPS: "center cursor on screen" scrolls horizontally
  Problem:    Using the "center cursor on screen" action causes unwanted
              horizontal scrolling in editors.
  Workaround: Scroll manually.
