Known Problems fixed in GPS 2.2.0

- D713-012 Improper substitution in XML files
  Problem:    When chaining multiple shell commands in an XML action, the
              second command can refer to the output of the first by using %1.
              However, this is improperly detected by GPS when using
              "%1.suffix" (ie the 1 character immediately followed by other
              chars
  Workaround: Put a blank after "%1 "

- DA17-002 Extra spaces adding in GPS shell commands
  Problem:    When chaining multiple commands in an action for instance, the
              result of previous commands always ends with a space. Likewise,
              a command like '("a")' results in two command line arguments,
              '("a"' and ')'.
  Workaround: Write commands in python when possible, or surround parameters
              in triple quotes

- DB23-002 Retrieve project attribute with spaces
  Problem:    When retrieving through a call to get_attribute_as_string() an
              attribute that contains spaces, they are all quoted by a
              backslash in the result string.
  Workaround: Use get_attribute_as_list and recreate a string from the
              output, without the backslashes.
