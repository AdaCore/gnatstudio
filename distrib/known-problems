Known Problems fixed in GPS 2.2.0

- DB23-002 Retrieve project attribute with spaces
  Problem:    When retrieving through a call to get_attribute_as_string() an
              attribute that contains spaces, they are all quoted by a
              backslash in the result string.
  Workaround: Use get_attribute_as_list and recreate a string from the
              output, without the backslashes.
