Known Problems fixed in GPS 3.2.0

- F220-009 Relative paths in project properties on Windows
  Problem:    On Windows, using the system file selection dialog will change
              the current directory. As a result, if you edit the project
              properties when using relative paths, and if you select, for
              any of the attributes, a file through this dialog, this will
              break the list of source files for this project
  Workaround: Use the GPS dialog to select files (see the preferences), or
              use absolute paths in the project properties editor.

- F216-011 Outline view not refreshed properly
  Problem:    It sometimes happens that the outline view indicates there are
              no entities even though an editor is selected. This generally
              happens either on startup or when a floating search window has
              just been used
  Workaround: click in another window, and then back in the editor to force
              a refresh

- F128-007 Project view: No direct response on expand sub item
  Problem:    Expanding a category needs two consecutive clicks.
  Workaround: Click two times on the category to expand it.

- F120-025 Python menu doesn't properly reload scripts
  Problem:    If you have added Python as a supported language in your
              project, GPS creates a python menu every time you edit a
              python file. This menu contains a "Reload" entry, which has no
              effect on the python console in fact.
  Workaround: type manually "import ..." or "reload (...)" in the python
              console

- F106-014 GPS auto-casing does not support unicode characters
  Problem:    GPS was not properly changing the case of identifiers with
              unicode characters (like the Greek letter Pi for example).
  Workaround: Disable the auto-casing in the preferences or press ctrl-q
              before the space as this disable the auto-casing of last word.

- F104-007 GPS split MDI when opening log files
  Problem:    The log files are opened by splitting the MDI when using the
              Edit log file VCS command. When using the command
              Commit (via revision log) the MDI is not split, the file is
              placed with the consoles if possible. For consistency, this is
              now the new behavior for the Edit log file.
  Workaround: Move the log editor manually

- F103-012 Loading new project breaks the desktop
  Problem:    If you load a project through the menu Project->Recent or
              Project->Load, the desktop is improperly updated, and some
              windows have unexpected sizes
  Workaround: Use the -P command line parameter to GPS to specify the
              project directly on the command line.

- EB16-002 Wrong parenthesis highlighting
  Problem:    Parenthesis in comment are taken into account when doing the
              highlighting of matching parenthesis.
  Workaround: None
