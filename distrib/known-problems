Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.3.0

- C326-004 Duplicate entries in dialog File->Open From Project
  Problem:    When using extending projects, duplicate source files might be
              displayed in this dialog (once for the original project and once
              for the extending project)
  Workaround: Click on any of the instance, they all point to the same file
