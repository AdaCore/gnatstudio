Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.1.1

- G322-032 Problems in completion with incomplete units
  Problem:    Smart completion may fail to propose entries when it involves 
              files where the unit name can't be retrieved (typically files
              with errors, or in the process of being modified). 
  Workaround: Edit the file to include the unit name, or ignore the missing
              completion.

- G322-027 Crash when searching for all occurrences of a pattern
  Problem:    GPS may crash when searching for all occurrences of a given
              pattern in all files from the project.
  Workaround: Use the "XXX is called by" contextual menu if appropriate.

- G322-011 Crash when closing GPS while entities are loaded
  Problem:    Closing GPS when the entities database is loading causes GPS to
              crash.
  Workaround: Terminate manually the task before closing GPS.

- G322-010 Cannot add a dependency on a mixed cased project file
  Problem:    An internal error prevents GPS from being able to import projects
              with file names not lower case.
  Woraround:  Use lower case project file names.

Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.1.0

- G305-005 Custom menu filters preventing menu display
  Problem:    When you create custom menus in python, and set a filter for
              these menus so that they are not always active, then the
              menu might not properly pop up.
  Workaround: Remove the filter, and test explicitly in the code associated
              with the callback for this menu.

- G227-035 GPS takes full cpu usage when displaying contextual menu on editor
  Problem:    If you right click in an editor that didn't have the focus yet,
              GPS will take 100% of the CPU until you click to disable the
              menu.
  Workaround: Left-click to cancel the contextual menu, and right-click again.

- G222-003 Bad indentation of extended return statements
  Problem:    When indenting Ada 2005 extended return statements, GPS
              may get confused and incorrectly indent following constructs.
  Workaround: Use simple return statements, or fix indentation manually.

- G219-025 GDI Object leak on Windows when the debugger is used
  Problem:    The debugger module of GPS has GDI object leaks on Windows.
  Workaround: If too many GDI objects are in use, exit GPS and restart it.

- G216-042 Very large clipboard data prevents GPS from starting.
  Problem:    When a very large amount of data is present in GPS's clipboard
              during exit, GPS won't be able to start the next time.
  Workaround: Remove the .gps/clipboard.xml file.

- G216-026 Outline View tooltips appearing outside of Outline View.
  Problem:    When the Outline View tooltips are enabled, it is possible that
              outline view tooltips appear even when the mouse pointer is out
              of the Outline View.
  Workaround: Move the mouse over the Outline View to cancel the tooltips, or
              disable the tooltips in the Outline View.

- G213-005 Menu items not properly updated
  Problem:    After a contextual menu is requested from the editor view, the
              menu items are not properly updated upon focus change.
  Workaround: Right click on the focused window to make the contextual menu
              appear, the menu items are then updated.

- G202-018 Searching backward for "Files in Project"
  Problem:    If you are doing a search in the context "Files in Project" or
              "Files...", and you press ctrl-p to go to the previous
              occurrence, then GPS would in fact go to the next occurrence.
              Since GPS doesn't in fact know how to search backward in such
              cases, ctrl-p now has no effect.
  Workaround: If you might have to use search backward, then instead search
              for all occurrences, and use the Location window to navigate
              between matches.

- G129-037 GPS cannot launch external HTML browsers
  Problem:    On some distributons of Linux, and possibly some UNIX plaforms,
              GPS cannot launch external HTML browsers, such as Nautilus or
              Firefox: for instance, when using the Help menu to display the
              tutorial or manuals, a line appears in the Messages window
              indicating that a browser is being launched, but nothing happens.
              This occurs when the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH is
              unset or empty.
  Workaround: Set your variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to a dummy value prior to
              launching GPS.

- G119-024 GPS Remote mode and rsh problems
  Problem:    When trying to connect to a remote machine using the rsh tool,
              specifying a remote command line to execute will make the rsh
              tool to actually use the rexec protocol, which is refused by
              most servers. The password in this case is never asked.
  Workaround: Either setup a passwordless rexec connection on the server side,
              or create a new shell for GPS, specifying an empty string as
              start command.

- G119-004 Selection lost on rigth click after end of line
  Problem:    In the editor, if you select several lines, each line gets
              selected entirely and even after the last character. If you
              right click on a selected line after the last character, the
              selection is removed.

- G118-008 Search dialog incorrectly resized when tabs are displayed
  Problem:    If you have chosen to always display the notebook tabs in the
              GPS MDI, then the search dialog is incorrectly resized when you
              change the "look in" field. This happens only when the search
              dialog is not floating.
  Workaround: Resize manually by dragging the bottom border of the search
              dialog.

- G210-001 List of files from project grow after project reloading
  Problem:    After doing a reload project, additional files where added to
              the list of files from project.
  Workaround: Restart GPS instead of doing a project reloading.

- G102-005 Wrong indentation in some Ada constructs
  Problem:    When trying to indent an Ada construct such as the following:
                (A =>
                  (B |
                   C=>D))
              GPS will sometimes incorrectly replace text in the second line.
  Workaround: Disable the 'Align associations on arrows' preference.

- FC13-014 Debugger menu items not made insensitive while debugger is running
  Problem:    While the program is running, some items in the "Debug" menu,
              such as "Run..." or "Next", should be greyed out. Activating
              those menu while the debugger is running could cause unexpected
              behavior.
  Workaround: Do not use debugger menus other than "Interrupt" while the
              program is running.

- FC11-011 Crash when entering an invalid font
  Problem:    After entering an empty or invalid text in the font selection
              entries in the Preferences dialog, GPS might crash.
  Workaround: Use the font chooser dialog to select the fonts

- FC07-018 GPS Remote mode is not working on Windows when a user is specified
  Problem:    The Microsoft's rsh tool on Windows expects the user to be
              specified after the host name. When specified before, the
              connection is refused.
  Workaround: Use the same user name on Windows and on the remote machine, and
              don't specify any in GPS.

- FB29-024 GPS complains about a missing gnatls executable
  Problem:    When using a cross GNAT compiler with no gnatls executable,
              GPS will complain at start up:
                Could not locate executable on path: gnatls
                Could not compute predefined paths for this project
  Workaround: This message can be safely ignored, assuming you have set
              the gnatlist project property.

- FB28-020 Regexp searching for ^ and $ blocks on empty lines
  Problem:    If you are searching for the regular expression "^" or "$,
              the search will be blocked on empty lines (ie GPS will keep
              matching the same place)
  Workaround: Move the cursor one character forward, and restart the search.

- FB27-017 Default shortcuts for /File/Save More
  Problem:    The shortcut "Alt-f o" is the same for /File/Open and
              /File/Save More, making it harder to access these from
              the keyboards. The latter has been changed to "Alt-f m"
              and the /File/Messages has been changed to "Alt-f g"
  Workaround: Press "o" until the appropriate menu is selected.

- FB23-029 Floating windows should be raised when they gain focus
  Problem:    If you are using floating windows, and select one of them
              through the Window menu, it should be raised to become
              fully visible
  Workaround: Select the window through your environment's usual method
              (alt-tab, taskbar,...).

- FB14-001 GPS.Process.expect returns only matched text
  Problem:    Calling the python function GPS.Process.expect only returns
              the part of the process output that matches the regular
              expression, but should really return all output till the
              end of the matched output.
  Workaround: Modify the regexp to start with "(.|\\n)*?"

- FB13-030 Problem with drag-and-drop from project explorer
  Problem:    Under some circumstances, drag-and-dropping a file node from
              the project explorer does not work.
  Workaround: Repeat the same action. The file will be correctly
              drag-and-dropped on the second attempt.

- FB13-028 Extra popup at the end of the search
  Problem:    At the end of the search on a file, GPS shows a popup asking if
              the user wants to start again from the beginning of the file.
              Clicking on "No" will display a second irrelevant popup saying
              that no more occurences are found.
  Workaround: Click on "Ok" on this second window.

- FB13-004 Multiple undo needed after Complete Block action.
  Problem:    After a Complete Block action multiple undo are needed
              to go back to the editor state as it was just before the
              action.
  Workaround: Issue two undo actions.

- FB10-013 Interactive selection dialog causes crash
  Problem:    When closing windows using a key shortcut while in the window
              selection dialog, GPS might crash if selecting in the list one of
              the editors that has been closed.
  Workaround: Do not close windows while in the interactive selection dialog

- FB07-014 Incorrect placement of Smart Completion window
  Problem:    When completing text near the bottom of the screen, the smart
              completion window might hide the current line from view if there
              is not enough space for it to fit between the current line and
              the bottom of the screen.
  Workaround: The smart completion functions normally: you can either keep
              using it without seeing the line, or remove it by pressing
              "escape".

- FB03-025 Shift left click does not work in the Windows view
  Problem:    Selecting multiple entries in the Windows view by using
              shift + left click does not work as expected.
  Workaround: Use control + left click to select multiple entries in the
              Windows view.

- FB03-022 Location view always looks for secondary location
  Problem:    The location view is always looking for secondary locations, even
              when the text displayed is a random text, e.g. the result of a
              search. In addition, it may generate unstability when the column
              number found is 0.
  Workaround: Do not expand the lines of the location view when there are
              extra lines. Use a system seach tool, like grep on unix, when
              the search process gets unstable.

- FB03-013 Window selection dialog not closed when bound to shift-tab
  Problem:    If you bind the function "Move to next window" to shift-tab,
              then the dialog is not closed when shift is released, as
              opposed to what would happen if you had used control-tab
  Workaround: press Esc to close the dialog.

- FB03-003 Pretty printer and files not from project
  Problem:    When running the pretty printer for an Ada file that doesn't
              belong to the project, it is expected that no project is passed
              to gnatpp. However, if the file had the same base name as a file
              from the project, an incorrect -P project was given to gnatpp
  Workaround: Add the file to the project, or remove the file with the same
              base name.

- FB03-002 C files incorrectly displayed in project explorer
  Problem:    In case you have two C (or any other language that is not Ada)
              files that have the same name and are stored in two distinct
              source directories that are part of your project, only one of
              them will be displayed in the project explorer (as a child of the
              source directory specified last in the project file) and it will
              furthermore be duplicated in this directory.
  Workaround: Use distinct file names.

- FB02-017 Obsolete location in the Call Tree view
  Problem:    When clicking on a location in the Call Tree view that
              corresponds to a file that does not exist anymore (e.g. because
              the file has been moved ot removed from the file system), an
              empty editor is opended and could cause some instabilities.
              GPS now inserts an appropriate entry in the Messages window
              instead.
  Workaround: Close the empty editor, or avoid clicking on these locations.

- FB02-011 Smart Completion window not disappearing on Delete
  Problem:    When pressing "delete" or when executing an action that deletes
              characters after the cursor, such as "Kill line", the smart
              completion window does not disappear.
  Workaround: Delete the completion window manually by pressing "escape".

- FB02-007 Bad display of array indexes in debugger data window
  Problem:    In some cases, when using the visual debugger to display array
              variables, index values are not properly computed and set to
              either Long_Integer'First or Long_Integer'Last. This appears in
              particular with multi-dimensional arrays with index ranges of
              enumerated types that include the first enumeration value.
  Workaround: Assuming you want to display the value of an array variable
              named My_Array, type in the debugger console:
                 (gdb) graph display `print my_array`
              The result of the print command will be displayed as a canvas
              item in the data window and will be refreshed every time the
              debugger stops. See the documentation for more information on
              the debugger console.

- FA24-025 Part of the Scenario View is hidden
  Problem:    When the Scenario View doesn't have sufficient width, parts of
              its contents might be hidden.
  Workaround: Increase manually the size of the Scenario View, for example
              by moving it to another area of the MDI, or by making it a
              floating window.

- FA24-013 Size of floating windows
  Problem:    When making a window floating, its size is often calculated to
              be small by default.
  Workaround: Resize the floated window manually.

- F925-005 Instability when commenting a folded block
  Problem:    Commenting a line that contains a folded block - such a line has
              a little '+' icon on the left - might cause unexpected behaviors
  Workaround: Unfold the block before commenting its first line.

- F921-003 Multiple views are not auto-saved
  Problem:    Let's assume the Editor/Auto saved preference is enabled. If
              you try to compile a file whose source buffer is modified and
              there are at least two views of this buffer, GPS does not
              automatically save the buffer.
  Workaround: You can close the redundant views or manually save the buffer
              before compiling.

- F919-009 Edition is allowed for read-only buffers
  Problem:    Even if an editor is marked as read-only it is still possible to
              do some edition in it by e.g. using the Edit/Comment Lines or the
              Edit/Refill menu, the smart completion widget or the alias
              expansion.
  Workaround: Avoid the above mentioned commands in a read-only editor. Note
              that in any case, GPS will refuse to save the local changes
              as long as the file is marked read-only.

- F913-006 Fix links to global routines in Python Extensions documentation
  Problem:    If you select the menu Help/Python Extensions, and click on a
              link to a global routine like GPS.current_context, the link was
              incorrectly generated
  Workaround: Click on "Global routines" on the left frame.

- F905-004 Executables listed twice for extending projects
  Problem:    If the project that is currently loaded explicitly mentions
              that its Main attribute is inherited from the extended project
              (for Main use Extended'Main) then all main files from the
              extended project will appear twice in the /Debug/Initialize
              menu.
  Workaround: No known workaround. In particular removing the redundant
              inheritance clause will not solve the problem since the entry
              that will remain in the menu will be the wrong one.

- F831-012 Copy pasting in floating editors
  Problem:    If you are copy-pasting using the /Edit/ menu and one of the
              editors involved is floating, then GPS fails to perform the
              operation
  Workaround: Use key shortcuts (through /Edit/Key Shortcuts) to perform
              the operation.

- F823-029 GPS can't commit activity with capital letter files on win32
  Problem:    On Windows, using Cygwin based Subversion, it is not
              possible to check-in an activity (as an atomic commit) if
              some files are imported using Source_Files (instead of
              Source_Dirs) and have some capital letters on the pathname.
  Workaround: Do not use the group commit option or commit the files on the
              command line.

- F818-013 Interrupting GPS.Process in task manager doesn't kill it
  Problem:    If you spawn a process in a script through GPS.Process,
              and interrupt it via the GPS task manager, the process itself
              is not killed, although it disappears from the GPS task manager
  Workaround: Kill the process using "kill" or the Windows task manager

- F818-003 Wrong automatic code fix with clause update
  Problem:    The auto-fix for messages like "non-visible declaration at
              file:line" does not add the proper with/use statements, and the
              entity is not correctly prefixed.
  Workaround: Fix manually the error, by adding the missing with, use, and/or
              prefix.

- F817-018 Cannot access menus with underscore from scripts
  Problem:    It isn't possible currently to execute a menu whose name
              contains an underscore from the script.
  Workaround: The underscore characters should be doubled

- F817-018 Cannot create custom toolbar separators
  Problem:    If you create an XML file with "<button/>" to insert a separator,
              nothing is done by GPS
  Workaround: None.

- F816-014 Incorrect support of non-ASCII characters in file names
  Problem:    If the name of the source files includes non-ASCII characters,
              and the file system is not UTF8-encoded, then GPS will
              incorrectly display the list of source files in various places,
              such as the Project View
  Workaround: Avoid non-ASCII characters in file names.

- F804-008 Cannot create key shortcuts for menus created from python
  Problem:    When a menu is created in python with GPS.Menu.create(), no
              key bindings can be defined for them through the
              /Edit/Key Shortcuts menu or gtk+'s dynamic key binding
  Workaround: Create an action (through "<action>" in XML), then associate a
              menu to it, and possibly a key shortcut as well.

- F731-006 Cannot unset the F4 keybinding
  Problem:    F4 is by default assigning to building the first main unit.
              You cannot currently unset this key shortcuts through the dialog
              in /Edit/Key shortcuts, since GPS will keep recreating it from
              one session to the next.
  Workaround: None found.

- F731-004 Cannot change font for Window view and Project view
  Problem:    The font used in these views comes from the global gtk+
              theme set for the system, and cannot be changed from the
              GPS preferences
  Workaround: These fonts can be modified by creating a file ~/.gps/gtkrc
              to change gtk+ theme. On linux desktops, there is generally
              a more convenient system-wide configuration.

- F710-022 GPS freezes in debug mode when ending command with \ or tab
  Problem:    Sending commands that are terminated with horizontal tabs and/or
              backslashes to the debugger via the console or a python script
              might freeze GPS e.g.
                in the debugger console:
                   (gdb) foo \<horizontal tab>
                   (gdb) \\<enter>
                in a python script:
                    debugger.send ("foo\\<horizontal tab>")
              where <horizontal tab> represents the character emitted when
              pressing the tabulation key and <enter> the enter one.
  Workaround: Avoid typing '\' or 'tab' at the end of a debugger command.

- F703-013 Compiling a file ignores extending projects
  Problem:    If you are using extending projects, and compile a file that is
              not overridden in the extending project, GPS compiles it in the
              context of the original project, but should really compile in
              the context of the extending project.
  Workaround: Use the menu /Build/Make/Custom... to enter your own custom
              compilation command.

- F629-007 Status bar says line 0 when indentation disabled
  Problem:    Let's consider a source editor for which no automatic indentation
              is performed either because it as been explicitely disable in the
              preference dialog or because the corresponding language is
              unknown. Set the cursor at the end of the editor and press
              ENTER. At this point the status bar says the cursor is located
              on line 0 which is obvisously not the case.
  Workaround: Move the cursor a line up and then down again to force the
              refresh of the line information in the status bar. You can also
              type some text.

- F622-014 Key shortcuts and menu mnemonics
  Problem:    When you create a new key shortcut for an action, and when this
              shortcut matches one of the mnemonics used by gtk+ for menus, for
              instance alt-w for the Window menu, then the key shortcut is
              incorrectly displayed in the menus.
  Workaround: Although not visible, the shortcut works as expected.

- F421-003 Duplicated files in the project explorer
  Problem:    Ada files that contains several compilation units are duplicated
              in the project explorer.
  Workaround: Follow the GNAT naming scheme and put only one unit per source
              file.

- F407-008 Problem in calculating width of line numbers
  Problem:    In editors with 10, or 100, or 1000 (etc) lines, the width
              of the space allocated to displaying the line numbers on the left
              of editors was not correctly computed, and did not display the
              leading 1.
  Workaround: This problem can be safely ignored, and disappears when adding
              or removing a line.

- EA19-015 Slowness when executing external processes
  Problem:    When GPS has to launch external programs that emit lot of output,
              for instance the Version Control operation "Add annotation", GPS
              takes a long time to process the output.
  Workaround: Launch the corresponding processes in an external terminal.

- E610-017 Drag and drop of a file does not work with spaces
  Problem:    Under Windows, when trying to drop a file (from e.g. the Windows
              explorer) in the GPS project explorer, if the file pathname
              contains spaces, then this file is not opened.
  Workaround: Open the file using File->Open or the File view instead.
