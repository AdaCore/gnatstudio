Known Problems fixed in GPS 2.2.0

- E106-004 GPS crashes when closing editors of a file that has been modified
  Problem:    When a file is modified outside of GPS, and when closing the
              editor associated to this file, it is possible that the editor
              is closed and the dialog "File has changed on disk" appears. In
              this case, choosing "Reload" causes GPS to crash.
  Workaround: Verify that the editor is still open before clicking on "Reload"

- DC21-008 It is impossible to use non-escaped "%" in GPS shell
  Problem:    When creating GPS shell actions, it is not possible to create
              command lines containing the "%" sign, GPS always attempts to
              expand it.
  Workaround: When you need to use the "%" sign, use a python command or an
              external wrapper.

- DB25-012 Contextual menu's filter in File View
  Problem:    If you create a custom contextual menu through an XML file,
              and add a filter so that it appears only in the Files View, this
              filter will not work (module="Files_View"), since the current
              module is considered the same as for the Project View
  Workaround: none found, the contextual menu will appear both in the Files
              and Project view if you use (module="Explorer")

- DB23-002 Retrieve project attribute with spaces
  Problem:    When retrieving through a call to get_attribute_as_string() an
              attribute that contains spaces, they are all quoted by a
              backslash in the result string.
  Workaround: Use get_attribute_as_list and recreate a string from the
              output, without the backslashes.

- DA17-002 Extra spaces added in GPS shell commands
  Problem:    When chaining multiple commands in an action for instance, the
              result of previous commands always ends with a space. Likewise,
              a command like '("a")' results in two command line arguments,
              '("a"' and ')'.
  Workaround: Write commands in python when possible, or surround parameters
              in triple quotes

- D713-012 Improper substitution in XML files
  Problem:    When chaining multiple shell commands in an XML action, the
              second command can refer to the output of the first by using %1.
              However, this is improperly detected by GPS when using
              "%1.suffix" (ie the 1 character immediately followed by other
              chars
  Workaround: Put a blank after "%1 "
