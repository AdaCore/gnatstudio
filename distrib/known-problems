Known Problems fixed in GPS 5.2.0 / GNATbench 2.7.0

- L910-004: GPS: no warning when color depth is lower than 24 bits per pixel
  Problem:    GPS does not detect that the display is lower than the minimal
              24 bits per pixels, which can results in crashes.
  Workaround: Check manually that the display depth is sufficient.

- L807-027: GB: scenario variables not passed to some tools invocations
  Problem:    The invocations of the stub generator, pretty printer, style
              checker, and metrics analyzer did not include the values of
              scenario variables defined by the project.
  Workaround: Assign the scenario variables' values outside of Eclipse, in
              the environment.

- L803-018: GPS: busy state after terminating a debug session
  Problem:    When running multiple debug sessions at the same time and
              terminating these sessions from a python script via e.g.
              GPS.execute_action ("/Debug/Terminate"), GPS may be left in
              a busy state (spinner icon running).
  Workaround: Ignore this visual glitch and restart GPS as soon as practical.

- L803-010: GPS: error when saving callgraph
  Problem:    When saving the contents of the callgraph to an XML file (for
              instance starting the debugger and switching perspective), an
              internal error could occur. This prevents the actual switch of
              perspective.
  Workaround: close the callgraph before you start the debugger.

- L720-022: GPS: text of exported messages includes Pango markup
  Problem:    When text of messages in Locations view is exported into the file
              it includes Pango markup in some conditions.
  Workaround: Remove markup by external text editor or command line tools.

- L713-004: GPS: crash when spawning a Run process and closing the console
  Problem:    When launching an external process that has its own interactive
              console in GPS, such as through the /Build/Run/Custom menu,
              GPS will not kill the process when closing the console, and
              may crash when the process actually exits.
  Workaround: Kill the process outside of GPS before closing the console, or
              leave the console open.

- L704-023: Excluded source files visible in project views
  Problem:    When defining an extending project, files excluded from the
              extending project using the Excluded_Source_Files or 
              Excluded_Source_List_File attributes are still listed in the
              project view.
  Workaround: This display problem can be safely ignored.

- L625-022: GPS: isearch.py window disappearing
  Problem:    Under some X servers, such as the Cygwin X11 server, the
              window for doing incremental searches in the isearch.py
              plugin disappears immediately after appearing.
  Workaround: Use the standard search dialog instead.

- L615-035: ECL: quick fix at EOF applied at the beginning of the file
  Problem:    If a quick fix is applied for a marker at the end of the file,
              the quick fix is applied at the beginnig of the file.
  Workaround: Add an empty line at the end of the file and compile the file.

- L520-004: GPS: wrong smart mixed casing after parenthesis
  Problem:    The contextual menu Casing proposes an incorrect casing for
              smart mixed casing on selection if starting with a parenthesis.
  Workaround: Do the proper casing manually.

- L510-043: GPS: rectangles.py off-by-one error in open and clear
  Problem:    The menus /Edit/Rectangles/Open and /Edit/Rectangles/Clear
              are off-by-one.
  Workaround: Select one more column than what you want to open or clear.

- L425-025: GPS: Python console blocked on incorrect indentation
  Problem:    When starting a block such as "def main():", if the next line
              is empty, the interactive console will keep showing the
              secondary prompt, and never return an error or the primary
              prompt.
  Workaround: Restart GPS. Also when writing multi-line Python constructs,
              prefer a text editor to the interactive console.

- L420-022: GPS: Crash when using the menu "Close all other editors".
  Problem:    When bringing up the contextual menu on notebook tabs and
              activating "Close all other editors", GPS might crash.
  Workaround: Use the global menu File->Close All Editors Except Current
              instead.

- L412-018: GPS: Interactive consoles using a proportional font
  Problem:    Interactive consoles, such as the GPS Shell or the Python
              console, use a proportional font rather than a fixed font, which
              is not natural for their use.
  Workaround: Set the "Default font" preference to a fixed font.

- L404-042: GB: Null pointer exception on references request
  Problem:    When issuing a request for references to an entity declared in
              a source file that has no corresponding GNAT project file (i.e.,
              no gpr file), a dialog box is presented, indicating a null pointer
              exception.
  Workaround: Only request references on files in projects that have an
              associated GNAT project file.

- L404-018: GPS: Wrong color of line highlighting
  Problem:    GPS uses the wrong color to highlight lines in source editors
              when a message is associated with this line.
  Workaround: Ignore this visual glitch.

- L417-023: GPS: Crash after creating a build target that contain underscores
  Problem:    When using the Target Configuration dialog to create a build
              target whose name contains an underscore, GPS might crash when
              refreshing the dialog.
  Workaround: Give a placeholder name to the target, and give its real name
              by modifying directly the file targets.xml in the .gps directory.

- L416-024: GPS: Crash when clearing call graphs while a computation is running
  Problem:    GPS might crash if call graphs are cleared while a "calls" or a
              "call by" operation is running.
  Workaround: Cancel the operation before clearing the call graph.

- L416-005: GPS: long time to open the dialog to add main files to a project
  Problem:    In the "Main files" section of the Project Properties dialog,
              when editing a project tree which contains a lot of source files,
              clicking on the "Add" button may cause GPS to wait for a long
              time before displaying a dialog.
  Workaround: Edit the project file manually.

- L416-003: GPS: click causes jump after viewing a dialog under Windows
  Problem:    Under Windows, when the focus is on an editor and a control-based
              shortcut is used to bring up a dialog (for instance ctrl-g for
              the "Goto Line" dialog), GPS may jump to the declaration when
              clicking on an entity in the editor.
  Workaround: Press the control key after going back to the editor.

- L413-013: GB: Unable to open Ada file from egit team provider
  Problem:    When opening an Ada file shared in the egit team provider
              from the history view you will get a null pointer exception.
  Workaround: None.

- L411-050: GPS: Only one item at a time can be moved in graph views
  Problem:    In the graph views, for instance the debugger data, or the
              dependency graph, it is no longer possible to move all items
              in a selection.
  Workaround: Move items one by one.

- L411-001: GB: Scanning toolchains takes almost a minute
  Problem:    When clicking the scan button on the toolchains table in the
              preference or project property page, it takes almost a minute
              to come back with any toolchains it finds.
  Workaround: None.

- L404-002: Align on arrows could clobber the sources
  Problem:    When calling align action on a line containing multiple arrows
              the code is not compilable anymore.
  Workaround: Align manually.

- L402-028: ECL: missing library refresh after build or clean.
  Problem:    After building or cleaning a library, the library content is not
              refreshed. This libray refresh problme occurs also after buiding
              or cleaning a project that use it.
  Workaround: Refresh manually the library project.

- L330-007: ECL: Metrics view not always displayed.
  Problem:    At workspace creation, or after an Ada perspective reset, the
              Metrics view is not displayed and an exception is logged.
  Workaround: Display the Metrics view manually. (Window -> Show View ->
              Other... -> Ada -> Metrics)

- L330-002: Extra references to generic entity
  Problem:    When looking for all references to a generic entity, extra
              references are listed in the Locations view, pointing to the
              locations of their instantiations.
  Workaround: Simply ignore the extra references.

- L329-016: ECL: Finish button not enabled when creating new ada source file
  Problem:    New Ada Source File menu when Project name is different from
              Project unit name stored in gpr file is not working. The Finish
              button is never enabled even if the source file name is valid.
  Workaround: Use the standard New File wizard.

- L329-027: GPS: Duplicate menu entries for build targets
  Problem:    When specifying a new build target through XML, if the target
              is using a "toplevel" category (ie, which starts and ends with
              an underscore), and if the target is set in a specific menu
              through the "menu" attribute, then this target will appear
              several times in the menu.
  Workaround: Do not display these targets in the menu, but create a specific
              menu to launch these targets, in Python or XML.

- L329-043: Too many ALI files parsed when using library projects
  Problem:    If your project tree includes library projects, the IDE parses
              too many .ali files when you select /Build/Load Xref in Memory,
              by loading files both from the object_dir and the library_dir.
  Workaround: Let the IDE load the files on demand, rather than force a full
              load manually.

- L328-003: GPS: The Entity View forgets the position of the separator
  Problem:    When the Entity View is in horizontal layout (with the list and
              the documentation window side-by-side), the position of the
              separator between windows is not remembered between sessions.
  Workaround: Position the separator manually.

- L325-001: GPS: Refill requires an extra undo
  Problem:    After a Refill operation (menu Edit->Selection->Refill, shortcut
              Ctrl+=), GPS requires two "Undo" to revert the refill.
  Workaround: Perform the extra undo manually.

- L323-022: GPS: Scrolling occurs in Project View when reloading project
  Problem:    When reloading the project, the Project View might scroll.
              This can be cumbersome if, for instance, you are using the
              Project View to add files to an extending project.
  Workaround: Scroll manually.

- L321-021: GPS: Refactoring read-only files shows dialog with duplicates
  Problem:    If you do a refactoring that involves a read-only file and
              you haven't selected the "Make writable" option, a dialog
              is displayed that indicates which file will not be modified.
              But a file might be listed several times (for instance when
              renaming an entity that has multiple references in the file)
  Workaround: This is a visual glitch only.

- L321-020: GPS: Refactoring "Name parameters" requires an extra undo
  Problem:    After a refactoring "Name parameters" operation, GPS requires
              two "Undo" to revert the refactoring.
  Workaround: Perform the extra undo manually.

- L321-019: Casing, Align actions on read-only buffer
  Problem:    When using align or casing actions on a read-only editor nothing
              happens without giving any clue except for a cryptic message
              in the message window.
  Workaround: None needed. You can make the source editor writable by clicking
              on the read-only label in the status bar.

- L314-011: GPS: Messages category blank in CodePeer report
  Problem:    Messages category filter panel is always empty for recent
              versions of CodePeer.
  Workaround: Ignore this filter panel.

- L312-031: CodePeer messages not removed when another project is loaded
  Problem:    CodePeer's race messages are displayed after loading of another
              project.
  Workaround: Ignore these messages.

- L301-025: GPS: Current editor performing automatic undo after refactoring
  Problem:    When attempting a refactoring through the menu Refactoring ->
              Rename <name of entity>, if the entity information is not
              up-to-date, pressing "Undo" in the confirmation dialog risks
              causing the current editor to "Undo" more than once.
  Workaround: After choosing "Undo" on the confirmation dialog, verify the
              state of the current editor, and press "Redo" as necessary.

- L215-043: GPS: expanded code not working in remote mode
  Problem:    When configured with a remote build server, the "expanded code"
              actions are still trying to use the local host's toolchain even
              when it's not available.
  Workaround: Manually generate the .dg file and copy it locally before
              executing the command, or install a local toolchain.

- L215-011: GPS: navigating causes automatic reloads
  Problem:    When using GPS to navigate through the code, for instance with
              the "Goto declaration of" menu, if the target editor is already
              open but has been modified outside of GPS, then it will be
              reloaded from disk without prompting the user first.
  Workaround: Avoid editing files outside of GPS.

- L213-022: GPS: tip-of-the-day hides modal dialogs
  Problem:    When opening GPS, if a modal dialog is brought up immediately
              after the main window (for instance when using the key shortcuts
              to launch a custom build), the tip-of-the-day window appears over
              the dialog, making it difficult to close.
  Workaround: Press ESC to close the dialog.

- L213-003: GPS: emacs plugin's ctrl-o does not work
  Problem:    When you load the Emacs plugin, it binds the key ctrl-o to
              "open line". The implementation for this function had a bug,
              and nothing was changed in the editor when pressing ctrl-o.
  Workaround: Press <enter> and <left arrow> will have the same result.

- L202-022: GPS: visual glitches when the Breakpoints editor is too small
  Problem:    When the Breakpoints editor is too small, there is a visual
              overlap in the display of its contents.
  Workaround: Resize, move, or float the Breakpoints editor.

- L131-031: GPS: jump to the current location when opening the search dialog
  Problem:    When the cursor in an editor is outside of the visible area,
              opening the Search dialog will cause the editor to scroll to
              show the position of the cursor.
  Workaround: Scroll manually, or position the cursor before opening the
              search dialog.

- L127-003: GPS: incorrect behavior of Locations filter
  Problem:    In some cases Locations filter can hide unexpected messages.
  Workaround: Export messages into text file and use another program to filter
              them.

- L124-025: GPS: plugin highlight_selection.py is slow on large files
  Problem:    When activating the plugin highlight_selection.py, GPS might be
              slow to react to a selection on editors for large files.
  Workaround: Deactivate highlight_selection.py

- L123-032: GPS: Editing Library Interface in Project Properties
  Problem:    The project attribute Library_Interface must contain unit names.
              However, GPS will set it using file names instead, and as a
              result the compiler complains.
  Workaround: Edit the project manually (*.gpr).

- L123-031: GPS: Project editor discards the Executable attribute
  Problem:    On Windows, when a project contains the "Executable" attribute
              to specify an explicit file name for the executable generated
              from a main unit, and the casing in the index isn't lower cases,
              the attribute is discarded every time the project is edited.
  Workaround: Fix the casing manually in the .gpr file to use lower cases
              only.

- KC20-025: GPS: Removing a server makes some other servers unusable
  Problem:    After removing a server from your server list, the other servers
              using the same shell or remote access tool become unusable.
  Workaround: Remove the server manually from the .gps/remote.xml file.

- KC12-009: Find All References missing refs with extending projects
  Problem:    When searching for all references from a file in an extending
              project, GPS fails to report the references that are in files
              that are in other non-extending projects.
  Workaround: Manually load all Xref information via the /Build menu.

- KC01-011: GPS: Show Entity <package> shows subprogram parameters
  Problem:    If you select the contextual menu Browsers/Show Entity for
              a package, the resulting box contains the parameters of the
              subprograms. The solution involves changes in GPS but also
              requires a version of GNAT more recent than 2012-02-08.
  Workaround: Ignore this extra information.

- KB16-001: GB: toolchain errors have no information and cannot be removed
  Problem:    Sometimes toolchains displayed from project's GNATbench
              properties, or Ada -> Toolchains preferences page have spurious
              errors reported. No extra information is available, and the
              error is still present even after removing/scanning process.
  Workaround: None.

- KA27-009: GPS: unwanted scrolling when canceling interactive search
  Problem:    When using the interactive search (plugin isearch.py), if the
              cursor is outside of the visible area, clicking on the editor
              to replace the cursor will cause unwanted scrolling.
  Workaround: Scroll back manually after the unwanted scrolling.

- KA04-024: GPS: wrong column highlighted for label:begin
  Problem:    When GPS highlights the current block which starts with a
              label followed by the begin keyword, the wrong column is used
              to highlight the block.
  Workaround: Disable block highlighting or ignore this visual glitch.

- K930-020: Recursive project source dirs and Windows host
  Problem:    When GPS is running on a Windows host, but driving a Unix
              build server, and the user edits the project to use recursive
              subdirectories, the syntax generated in the project file is
              Windows specific and rejected by the build server.
  Workaround: Edit the project manually to replace "\**" with "/**".

- K930-009: GB: Search view double clicking on Ada references exceptions
  Problem:    In some cases, when double clicking on an Ada reference from the
              Search view, the ada file is opened but the cursor is not moved
              to the reference.
  Workaround: Retry the Ada references search process.

- K926-014: GB: GNATbench freezes when viewing/editing Ada files
  Problem:    Randomly when using the GNATbench Ada editor for code edition
              or program debug, GNATbench freezes. The only solution to get
              rid of the lock is to kill GNATbench, and launch it back.
  Workaround: - Run menu Window => Preferences
              - Open Ada => Editor preferences page
              - Disable the 3 following features
                1- Tooltips should be displayed automatically.
                2- Enable Code Assist.
                3- Enable Code Assist auto activation.

- K804-029: GPS: cannot bind Tab key to menus and use it to navigate
  Problem:    When assigning the Tab key to a menu, for instance
              /Edit/Format Selection, it is not possible to use the Tab key
              to navigate in the non-modal dialogs such as the Search dialog.
  Workaround: Use another key shortcut, or bind the Tab key to the
              corresponding action if it exists (for instance the action
              "Format Selection" in the "Editor" section in the Key Shortcuts
              view).

- K726-011: GPS: Source editor is not raised on double click in CodePeer report
  Problem:    When double clicking in the CodePeer report, a source editor is
              opened but not raised in front.
  Workaround: Raise the source editor window manually by clicking on its tab.

- K718-016: GB: file with last modification time in the future corrupts GB cache
  Problem:    When a file has its last modification time in the future, some
              GB feature (metrics, construct database) are not functional
              because its modifications are not taken into account.
  Workaround: Touch the file and restart eclipse. 
  
- K325-019: GPS: autofix for lines containing only spaces
  Problem:    The autofix for blanks at end of line removes the whole line if
              the line is composed only by spaces.
  Workaround: Do not use autofix on such lines or replace manually the removed
              line by an empty line.

- L113-025: GPS: cursor at wrong position after alias expansion
  Problem:    When alias text contains multibyte UTF-8 characters cursor is
              placed at wrong position after expansion.
  Workaround: Do not use multibyte UTF-8 characters in text of an alias.

- F816-013: GPS: Highlighting for comments in C with international characters
  Problem:    GPS does not properly compute the syntax coloring for comments
              which contain international characters in C sources.
  Workaround: No workaround.

- L810-017: GPS: Minor display glitch in Locations View
  Problem:    Category in Locations View doesn't correctly displayed as
              result of 'Find All' search if pattern contains markup
              characters.
  Workaround: No workaround.
