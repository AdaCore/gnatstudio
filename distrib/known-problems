Known Problems fixed in GPS 5.2.1 / GNATbench 2.7.1

- M214-041: GB: UI freeze at startup on right click.
  Problem:    GB UI does'nt reply if a project explorer or editor
              contextual menu is displayed before the end of the GB
              initialization.
  Workaround: wait until startup jobs completion before right clicking.

- M208-003: GB: SPARK & Codepeer plugin top level menus not displayed.
  Problem:    When running eclipse 4.2 or Wind River Workbench 3.3, enabling
              the SPARK & Codepeer menubar menus desn't display any
              additional menus.
  Workaround: Use contextual menus.
  
- LB29-024: WB: When debugger is active, breakpoints menu is not displayed.
  Problem:    During a debug session, breakpoints menus in ada code are not
              displayed.
  Workaround: Set breakpoints double click the left margin. Use breakpoints
              view to manage breakpoint. If required, configure breakpoints
              before starting the debug session.
  
- LB21-056: GB: Preview pane hidden on project unit name wizard page
  Problem:    When converting an existing project to an Ada project, the
              preview pane on the wizard page where you select the project
              unit name is hidden.
  Workaround: Edit the project unit name.

- LB21-039: GPS should not launch when the display depth is under 24 bits
  Problem:    GPS crashes unpredictably when using display depths shallower
              than 24 bits per pixel.
  Workaround: None known.

- LB27-003: Infinite loop when clicking on C++ enum type
  Problem:    When right-clicking on a C++ enum variable, GPS attempts to
              compute cross-reference information for the enum type. It is
              possible for GPS to lock up during this operation.
  Workaround: This requires an update of GPS.

- LB21-021: GPS: Navigation problem in goto type declaration
  Problem:    The functionality of "Goto type declaration" moves the cursor
              to the location of the object declaration instead of moving
              it to the location of the type declaration.
  Workaround: Use "Goto type declaration" twice: the first one to move the
              cursor to the location of the object declaration and repeat it
              to move the cursor to the declaration of the corresponding type.

- LB17-014: GB: multiple SPARK/Codepeer menus in menubar
  Problem:    Moving the selection in navigator using arrows may lead to have
              SPARK/Codepeer menus displayed more than once in the menubar.
  Workaround: Hide the SPARK/Codepeer menubar configuring the perspective
              using the Window => Customize Perspective... menu and then
              disabling GNATbench SPARK/Codepeer Menubar menus in command
              group availability.               

- LA24-013: Incorrect indentation of lines while editing function calls
  Problem:    When indenting a single line in the middle of a complex function
              call containing several parentheses, the indentation engine may
              malfunction and indent the line incorrectly.
  Workaround: Select the entire function call and indent it as a whole.

- LA11-013: Aspect clause on a record causes incorrect indentation
  Problem:    When using an Ada 2012 aspect clause at the end of a record,
              such as in the example below, the indentation engine may
              incorrectly unindent an extra level.
                 type R is record
                    X : Integer;
                 end record with Size => 32;
  Workaround: Use a 'for' clause instead to specify the aspect.

- L814-016: GPS: Code completion of typedef struct types
  Problem:    In variables whose type is a C/C++ 'typedef struct', completion
              of components does not work.
  Workaround: When editing, temporarily enter and use the type of the object
              rather than the name of the object. You can then use GPS
              completions as you normally would. When finished, replace the
              temporary prefix with the intended variable name.

Known Problems fixed in GPS 5.2.0 / GNATbench 2.7.0

- L915-005: GPS: Some "align" actions cancel the selection
  Problem:    When using the interactive actions defined in the "align.py"
              plugin, GPS might cancel the selection after the replace is
              done, which makes it difficult to chain such actions.
  Workaround: Replace the selection manually, or install a more recent version
              of the align.py plugin.

- L913-039: GPS: Custom build targets lost after editing via the dialog
  Problem:    When editing build targets using the Target Configuration
              dialog, GPS might remove any custom made target using the
              "Custom" model.
  Workaround: Save the targets by creating a GPS plugin from the
              .gps/targets.xml file.

- L910-004: GPS: no warning when color depth is lower than 24 bits per pixel
  Problem:    GPS does not detect whether the display is capable of showing at
              least 24 bits per pixel.  If the color depth is not sufficient,
              crashes may result.
  Workaround: Manually check that the display depth is sufficient.

- L807-027: GB: scenario variables not passed to certain tool invocations
  Problem:    The invocations of the stub generator, pretty printer, style
              checker, and metrics analyzer do not include the values of
              scenario variables defined by the project.
  Workaround: Assign the scenario variables' values outside of Eclipse, in
              the environment.

- L803-018: GPS: busy state after terminating a debug session
  Problem:    When running multiple debug sessions simultaneously and
              these sessions are terminated from a Python script, for instance
              via GPS.execute_action ("/Debug/Terminate"), GPS may be left in
              a busy state (spinner icon running).
  Workaround: Ignore this visual glitch and restart GPS as soon as is
              practical.

- L803-010: GPS: error when saving callgraph
  Problem:    When saving the contents of the callgraph to an XML file (for
              instance, this happens when starting the debugger and switching
              perspectives), an internal error could occur.  This prevents the
              perspective switch.
  Workaround: close the callgraph before you start the debugger.

- L720-022: GPS: text of exported messages includes Pango markup
  Problem:    When Locations view messages are exported to a file, Pango markup
              is included under certain conditions.
  Workaround: Remove markup using external text editor or command line tools.

- L713-004: GPS: crash when spawning a Run process and closing the console
  Problem:    When launching an external process that has its own interactive
              console in GPS, such as through the /Build/Run/Custom menu,
              GPS will not kill the process when closing the console, and
              may crash when the process actually exits.
  Workaround: Kill the process outside of GPS before closing the console, or
              leave the console open.

- L704-023: Excluded source files are visible in project views
  Problem:    When defining an extending project, files excluded from the
              extending project using the Excluded_Source_Files or 
              Excluded_Source_List_File attributes are still listed in the
              project view.
  Workaround: This is a false indication display problem, and will not affect
              anything other than the display.

- L625-022: GPS: isearch.py window disappears
  Problem:    When using certain X servers such as Cygwin X11, the window for
              doing incremental searches in the isearch.py plugin disappears
              immediately after appearing.
  Workaround: Use the standard search dialog instead.

- L615-035: ECL: quick fix at EOF applied at the beginning of the file
  Problem:    If a quick fix is applied for a marker at the end of the file,
              the quick fix is actually applied at the beginning of the file.
  Workaround: Manually add an empty line at the end of the file and compile it.

- L520-004: GPS: incorrect smart mixed casing after parenthesis
  Problem:    The Casing contextual menu proposes an incorrect casing for
              smart mixed casing on selection if starting with a parenthesis.
  Workaround: Alter the casing manually.

- L510-043: GPS: rectangles.py off-by-one bug in open and clear
  Problem:    The menus /Edit/Rectangles/Open and /Edit/Rectangles/Clear
              operate on one fewer column than is input.
  Workaround: Select one more column than what you want to open or clear.

- L425-025: GPS: Python console blocked on incorrect indentation
  Problem:    When starting a block such as "def main():", if the next line
              is empty, the interactive console will keep showing the
              secondary prompt, and never return an error or the primary
              prompt.
  Workaround: Restart GPS. Also when writing multi-line Python constructs,
              use a text editor rather than the interactive console.

- L420-022: GPS: Crash when using the menu item "Close all other editors".
  Problem:    Using the notebook tab contextual menu, when activating "Close
              all other editors", GPS might crash.
  Workaround: Use the global menu File->Close All Editors Except Current
              instead.

- L412-018: GPS: Interactive consoles use a proportional font
  Problem:    Interactive consoles, such as the GPS Shell or the Python
              console, use a proportional font rather than a fixed-width font,
              which is not ideal for working with code.
  Workaround: Set the "Default font" preference to any fixed-width font.

- L404-042: GB: Null pointer exception on references request
  Problem:    When issuing a request for references to an entity declared in
              a source file that has no corresponding GNAT project (GPR) file,
              a dialog box is presented indicating a null pointer exception.
  Workaround: Only request references on files in projects that have an
              associated GNAT project file.

- L404-018: GPS: Wrong line highlight color
  Problem:    GPS uses the wrong color to highlight lines in source editors
              when messages are associated with the lines.
  Workaround: Ignore this visual glitch.

- L417-023: GPS: Crash after creating a build target that contains underscores
  Problem:    When using the Target Configuration dialog to create a build
              target whose name contains an underscore, GPS might crash when
              refreshing the dialog.
  Workaround: Use a placeholder without underscores for the target name, then
              manually modify the targets.xml file in the .gps directory with
              the desired name.

- L416-024: GPS: Crash when clearing call graphs while a computation is running
  Problem:    GPS may crash if call graphs are cleared while a "calls" or a
              "call by" operation is running.
  Workaround: Cancel the operation before clearing the call graph.

- L416-005: GPS: opening dialog to add main files to a project takes too long
  Problem:    In the "Main files" section of the Project Properties dialog,
              when editing a project tree which contains many source files,
              clicking on the "Add" button may cause GPS to process for a long
              time before displaying a dialog.
  Workaround: Edit the project file manually.

- L416-003: GPS: after using a ctrl-key shortcut, click causes jump on Windows
  Problem:    Under Windows, when the focus is on an editor and a control-based
              shortcut is used to bring up a dialog (for instance ctrl-g for
              the "Goto Line" dialog), a subsequent click on an entity in the
              editor may be interpreted as a ctrl-click and GPS may jump to the
              declaration of that entity.
  Workaround: Tap the control key after going back to the editor.

- L413-013: GB: Unable to open Ada file from egit team provider
  Problem:    When opening an Ada file shared in the egit team provider
              from the history view, you may get a null pointer exception.
  Workaround: None.

- L411-050: GPS: Only one item at a time can be moved in graph views
  Problem:    In the graph views, for instance in the debugger data or the
              dependency graph, it is no longer possible to move all items
              in a selection.
  Workaround: Move items one by one.

- L411-001: GB: Scanning toolchains takes almost a minute
  Problem:    When clicking the scan button on the toolchains table in the
              preference or project property page, it takes almost a minute
              to come back with any toolchains it finds.
  Workaround: None.

- L404-002: Align on arrows could clobber the sources
  Problem:    When calling the align action on a line containing multiple
              arrows, the source file is no longer compilable.
  Workaround: Align manually.

- L402-028: ECL: missing library refresh after build or clean.
  Problem:    After building or cleaning a library, the library content display
              is not refreshed.  This library refresh problem also occurs after
              building or cleaning a project that uses the library.
  Workaround: Manually refresh the library project.

- L330-007: ECL: Metrics view not always displayed.
  Problem:    At workspace creation, or after an Ada perspective reset, the
              Metrics view is not displayed and an exception is logged.
  Workaround: Display the Metrics view manually. (Window -> Show View ->
              Other... -> Ada -> Metrics)

- L330-002: Extra references to generic entity
  Problem:    When looking for all references to a generic entity, extra
              references are listed in the Locations view, pointing to the
              locations of their instantiations.
  Workaround: Simply ignore the extra references.

- L329-016: ECL: Finish button not enabled when creating new Ada source file
  Problem:    When the project name is different from the project unit name
              stored in the gpr file, the New Ada Source File menu does not
              function properly.  The Finish button is not enabled even if the
              source file name is valid.
  Workaround: Use the standard New File wizard.

- L329-027: GPS: Duplicate menu entries for build targets
  Problem:    When specifying a new build target through XML, if the target
              is using a "toplevel" category (i.e., it starts and ends with
              an underscore), and if the target is set in a specific menu
              through the "menu" attribute, then this target will appear
              several times in the menu.
  Workaround: Do not display these targets in the menu, but create a specific
              menu to launch these targets, in Python or XML.

- L329-043: Too many ALI files parsed when using library projects
  Problem:    If your project tree includes library projects, the IDE parses
              too many .ali files when you select /Build/Load Xref in Memory,
              by loading files both from the object_dir and the library_dir.
  Workaround: Let the IDE load the files on demand, rather than forcing a full
              load manually.

- L328-003: GPS: The Entity View forgets the position of the separator
  Problem:    When the Entity View uses a horizontal layout (with the list and
              the documentation window side-by-side), the position of the
              separator between windows is not persistent between sessions.
  Workaround: Position the separator manually.

- L325-001: GPS: Refill requires an extra undo
  Problem:    After a Refill operation (menu Edit->Selection->Refill, shortcut
              Ctrl+=), GPS requires two "Undo"s to revert the refill.
  Workaround: Perform the extra undo manually.

- L323-022: GPS: Scrolling occurs in Project View when reloading project
  Problem:    When reloading the project, the Project View might scroll.
              This can be cumbersome if, for instance, you are using the
              Project View to add files to an extending project.
  Workaround: Scroll manually.

- L321-021: GPS: Refactoring read-only files shows dialog with duplicates
  Problem:    If you do a refactoring that involves a read-only file and
              you haven't selected the "Make writable" option, a dialog pops
              up showing files that will not be modified.  Some files will
              be listed multiple times (for instance when renaming an entity
              that has multiple references in the file).
  Workaround: This is a visual glitch only.

- L321-020: GPS: Refactoring "Name parameters" requires an extra undo
  Problem:    After a "Name parameters" refactoring operation, GPS requires
              two "Undo"s to revert the refactoring.
  Workaround: Perform the extra undo manually.

- L321-019: Casing, Align actions on read-only buffer
  Problem:    When invoking align or casing actions on a read-only editor,
              nothing happens and no problem indication occurs except for a
              cryptic message in the message window.
  Workaround: None needed. You can make the source editor writable by clicking
              on the read-only label in the status bar.

- L314-011: GPS: Messages category blank in CodePeer report
  Problem:    Messages category filter panel is always empty for recent
              versions of CodePeer.
  Workaround: Ignore this filter panel.

- L312-031: CodePeer messages not removed when another project is loaded
  Problem:    CodePeer's race messages are displayed after loading of another
              project.
  Workaround: Ignore these messages.

- L301-025: GPS: Current editor performs automatic undo after refactoring
  Problem:    When attempting a refactoring through the menu Refactoring ->
              Rename <name of entity>, if the entity information is not
              up-to-date, pressing "Undo" in the confirmation dialog risks
              causing the current editor to "Undo" more than once.
  Workaround: After choosing "Undo" on the confirmation dialog, verify the
              state of the current editor, and press "Redo" as necessary.

- L215-043: GPS: expanded code not working in remote mode
  Problem:    When configured with a remote build server, the "expanded code"
              actions expect to find and use a toolchain on the local host,
              which is not necessarily present.
  Workaround: Manually generate the .dg file and copy it locally before
              executing the command, or install a local toolchain.

- L215-011: GPS: navigating causes automatic reloads
  Problem:    When using GPS to navigate through code, for instance with
              the "Goto declaration of" menu, if the target editor is already
              open but has been modified outside of GPS, then it will be
              reloaded from disk without prompting the user first.
  Workaround: Avoid editing files outside of GPS.

- L213-022: GPS: tip-of-the-day hides modal dialogs
  Problem:    When opening GPS, if a modal dialog is brought up immediately
              after the main window (for instance when using the key shortcuts
              to launch a custom build), the tip-of-the-day window appears over
              the dialog, making it difficult to close.
  Workaround: Press ESC to close the dialog.

- L213-003: GPS: Emacs plugin's ctrl-o does not work
  Problem:    When you load the Emacs plugin, it binds the key ctrl-o to
              "open line". The implementation for this function had a bug,
              and nothing was changed in the editor when pressing ctrl-o.
  Workaround: Press <enter> and <left arrow> will have the same result.

- L202-022: GPS: visual glitches when the Breakpoints editor is too small
  Problem:    When the Breakpoints editor is too small, there is a visual
              overlap in the display of its contents.
  Workaround: Resize, move, or float the Breakpoints editor.

- L131-031: GPS: jumps to the current location when opening the search dialog
  Problem:    When the cursor in an editor is outside of the visible area,
              opening the Search dialog will cause the editor to scroll to
              show the position of the cursor.
  Workaround: Scroll manually, or position the cursor before opening the
              search dialog.

- L127-003: GPS: incorrect behavior of Locations filter
  Problem:    In some cases, the Locations filter can hide unexpected messages.
  Workaround: Export messages into text file and use another program to filter
              them.

- L124-025: GPS: plugin highlight_selection.py is slow on large files
  Problem:    When activating the plugin highlight_selection.py, GPS might be
              slow to react to a selection on editors for large files.
  Workaround: Deactivate highlight_selection.py

- L123-032: GPS: Editing Library Interface in Project Properties
  Problem:    The project attribute Library_Interface must contain unit names.
              However, GPS will set this attribute using file names instead,
              and as a result the compiler complains.
  Workaround: Edit the project manually (*.gpr).

- L123-031: GPS: Project editor discards the Executable attribute
  Problem:    On Windows, when a project contains the "Executable" attribute
              to specify an explicit file name for the executable generated
              from a main unit, and the casing in the index isn't lower cased,
              the attribute is discarded every time the project is edited.
  Workaround: Fix the casing manually in the .gpr file to use lower case
              only.

- KC20-025: GPS: Removing a server makes some other servers unusable
  Problem:    After removing a server from your server list, the other servers
              using the same shell or remote access tool become unusable.
  Workaround: Remove the server manually from the .gps/remote.xml file.

- KC12-009: Find All References missing refs with extending projects
  Problem:    When searching for all references from a file in an extending
              project, GPS fails to report the references that are in files
              that are in other non-extending projects.
  Workaround: Manually load all Xref information via the /Build menu.

- KC01-011: GPS: Show Entity <package> shows subprogram parameters
  Problem:    If you select the contextual menu Browsers/Show Entity for
              a package, the resulting box contains the parameters of the
              subprograms. The solution involves changes in GPS but also
              requires a version of GNAT more recent than 2012-02-08.
  Workaround: Ignore this extra information.

- KB16-001: GB: toolchain errors have no information and cannot be removed
  Problem:    Sometimes toolchains displayed from the project's GNATbench
              properties or the Ada -> Toolchains preferences page have
              spurious errors reported. No extra information is available,
              and the error is still present even after a removing/scanning
              process.
  Workaround: None.

- KB10-053: GB: GNAT project file using relative path must be in the workspace.
  Problem:    In GNATbench properties, specifying a relative path to a GNAT
              project file located outside the workspace generates "file not
              found" errors.
  Workaround: If possible import the file in the workspace; otherwise, make the
              path absolute.

- KA27-009: GPS: unwanted scrolling when canceling interactive search
  Problem:    When using the interactive search (plugin isearch.py), if the
              cursor is outside of the visible area, clicking on the editor
              to replace the cursor will cause unwanted scrolling.
  Workaround: Scroll back manually after the unwanted scrolling.

  Problem:    When GPS highlights the current block which starts with a
              label followed by the begin keyword, the wrong column is used
              to highlight the block.
  Workaround: Disable block highlighting or ignore this visual glitch.

- K930-020: Recursive project source dirs and Windows host
  Problem:    When GPS is running on a Windows host, but driving a Unix
              build server, and the user edits the project to use recursive
              subdirectories, the syntax generated in the project file is
              Windows specific and rejected by the build server.
  Workaround: Edit the project manually to replace "\**" with "/**".

- K930-009: GB: double click on Ada references in Search View causes exceptions
  Problem:    In some cases, when double clicking on an Ada reference from the
              Search view, the Ada file is opened but the cursor is not moved
              to the reference.
  Workaround: Retry the Ada references search process.

- K926-014: GB: GNATbench freezes when viewing/editing Ada files
  Problem:    When using the GNATbench Ada editor to edit code or debug
              programs, GNATbench randomly freezes. Restarting GNATbench
              is then necessary to remove the lock causing the freeze.
  Workaround: - Invoke menu Window => Preferences.
              - Open the Ada => Editor preferences page.
              - Disable the following features:
                1- Tooltips should be displayed automatically.
                2- Enable Code Assist.
                3- Enable Code Assist auto activation.

- K804-029: GPS: cannot bind Tab key to menus and use it to navigate
  Problem:    When assigning the Tab key to a menu, for instance
              /Edit/Format Selection, it is then not possible to use the Tab
              key to navigate in non-modal dialogs such as the Search dialog.
  Workaround: Use another key shortcut, or bind the Tab key to the
              corresponding action if it exists (for instance the action
              "Format Selection" in the "Editor" section in the Key Shortcuts
              view).

- K726-011: GPS: Source editor is not raised on double click in CodePeer report
  Problem:    When double clicking in the CodePeer report, a source editor is
              opened but not raised to the front.
  Workaround: Raise the source editor window manually by clicking on its tab.

- K718-016: GB: file with last modification time in the future corrupts cache
  Problem:    When a file has its last modification time in the future, some
              GB features (metrics, construct database) are not functional
              because its modifications are not taken into account.
  Workaround: Fix the relevant OS's date/time as necessary, touch the file
              and restart eclipse. 
  
- K325-019: GPS: autofix for lines containing only spaces
  Problem:    The autofix for blanks at the end of the line removes the whole
              line, if the line is composed of only spaces.
  Workaround: Do not use autofix on such lines or manually replace the removed
              line with an empty line.
