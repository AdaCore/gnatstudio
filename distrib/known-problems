Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.3.0

- C711-002 Find in current file switches editor
  Problem:    If you select Control-F to open the search window while in an
              editor, GPS switches the selected window, and thus makes it hard
              to search in the current file
  Workaround: Dock the search window in one of the sides of GPS

- C707-020 Save As fails for read-only files
  Problem:    Read-only files can not be saved, even with a different name
  Workaround: Click on the Read-Only box at the bottom of the editor to
              temporarily override the status

- C703-014 Locations window is raised for every compiling message
  Problem:    When the compilation outputs many error/warning messages,
              the locations window is raised above the messages window with
              every new error.
  Workaround: Move the locations window or the messages window to another part
              of the MDI.

- C703-005 Pasting text from the clipboard doesn't overwrite the selection
  Problem:    If you are doing an interactive search, replacing the text using
              the keyboard shortcut for "Paste" doesn't replace the selected
              text.
  Workaround: Use the Search/Replace function.

- C627-007 Exec directory settings lost when editing project properties
  Problem:    If you have specified a relative path for the executables
              directory and you edit the project properties, it can happen
              that the executables directory is corrupted if the current
              directory has changed.
  Workaround: Either use absolute paths for the executables directory, or
              make sure the current directory is the one containing the
              project file before you edit the project properties.

- C626-007 Extra blank lines in messages window under Windows
  Problem:    When running external processes (e.g. using a custom file)
              that output CR/LF line terminators, extra blank line are
              displayed in the messages window.
  Workaround: Add a wrapper around the external process that transforms
              CR/LF into LF.

- C625-002 Debugger breakpoints not always appearing in the GPS source editor
  Problem:    When in debugger mode, setting a breakpoint by clicking on the
              dots in the editor does not always display a breakpoint icon.
  Workaround: The breakpoint is active even if it's not displayed. To delete
              it, type "delete <number of the breakpoint>" in the debugger
              console.

- C618-002 Font size changes under Windows when highlighting Messages window
  Problem:    Under Windows, when the Messages window gets some output
              and does not have the focus, the size of the title font is
              changed, in addition to the change of color
  Workaround: None

- C616-002 Incorrect handling of relative exec directories
  Problem:    If the executable directory was defined as a relative path in
              the project file, then GPS will not be able to run or debug
              the executable
  Workaround: Change the current directory with File->Change Directory to be
              the one that contains the project file before doing a run or a
              debug.

- C611-012 Cross-references do not work with C under Solaris
  Problem:    Under some circumstances, on Solaris, the navigation in C/C++
              files does not work and displays the message "No cross-reference
              information found for (...)".
  Workaround: None.

- C611-001 Protection domain entry not accessible in GPS
  Problem:    The Protection Domains entry in the Debug->Data menu
              is not enabled for AE debuggers.
  Workaround: Use the gdb console to view and switch protection
              domains: "info pds" and "pd <pd_id>" respectively.

- C605-005 Duplicate key bindings in Build menu
  Problem:    If you are using an extending project, then the build menu
              (Build->Make) will contain an entry for the executables from
              the project and its parent, but both entries will have the same
              key shortcut associated with them.
  Workaround: use the contextual menu on projects in the project explorer to
              select which executable you want to build.

- C605-003 Key binding not reset when new project loaded
  Problem:    Some of the key bindings are incorrectly reset when a new
              project is loaded. For instance, if you have set a keybinding
              for Build->Make->All Main Units, and then load a new project,
              pressing a key will still build the units of the old project.
  Workaround: Select the menu with the mouse instead of using the key

- C604-004 Switching windows with Ctrl+<key> doesn't allow typing characters
  Problem:    On windows, using control-<key> to switch between windows
              disables the possibility to select windows by typing their names
  Workaround: Use the Window menu to switch between windows

- C513-008 Untitled files saved in desktop
  Problem:    When saving a desktop GPS will improperly save untitled files,
              and generate an error when trying to load the desktop.
  Workaround: Close or save untitled files before saving the desktop, or
              manually edit the file ~/.gps/desktop

- C511-002 Project not recomputed after using "save as"
  Problem:    When a file is saved with "save as", the file doesn't appear
              immediately in the project view, and will not be loaded correctly
              if it contains compilation errors
  Workaround: Select the menu Project->Recompute Project after saving

- C509-003 Incorrect expansion of -gnatVa compiler switch
  Problem:    If your project used -gnatVa, and you edit the compiler switches
              through the project properties editor, none of the check boxes
              in Validity Checkin are selected
  Workaround: Select the boxes you wish to activate. This just impacts the
              initial value.

- C508-012 Main units from extended projects now displayed in Debug->Initialize
  Problem:    The main units defined in some extended projects are not
              shown in the Debug->Initialize, although they are displayed in
              the Build->Make menu
  Workaround: Initialize the debugger with no main unit, and then load the
              executable you wish to debug through Debug->Debug->Load File

- C504-003 Alias file not saved properly under Windows
  Problem:    In some cases, extra CR character are improperly printed when
              saved the aliases under Windows.
  Workaround: Remove the extra CR characters in the file %HOME%\.gps\aliases

- C501-006 Child projects cannot be edited graphically
  Problem:    When a child project (ie whose name has a '.') is edited through
              the project properties editor, it cannot be saved afterwards.
  Workaround: Either edit the project manually, or save it under a new name and
              rename it afterwards

- C501-004 Incorrect naming scheme when saving new Ada file
  Problem:    When you save a newly created Ada file, the suggested default
              name used the GNAT naming scheme (.adb and .ads), instead of
              the root project's
  Workaround: Override the default value with the proper name

- Incorrect placement of cursor after insertion of <return>
  Problem:    When auto-indentation is actived and one presses <return> in the
              middle of a line, the cursor ends up at the end of the second
              line instead of the beginning
  Workaround: Press <home> just after <return>

- C429-010 Automatic Uncomment Lines operations sometimes fail.
  Problem:    When uncommenting Ada lines that only contain "--", or lines
              starting with spaces, with less than two spaces after "--",
              the line is not uncommented.
  Workaround: Uncomment those lines manually.

- C428-025 Read-only editors can be modified by internal actions.
  Problem:    When an editor is set as read-only, its contents can still be
              modified by actions such as undo/redo or automatic code fixing.
  Workaround: Do not use undo/redo or automatic code fixing on read-only
              files.

- C425-019 Handling of projects with no supported language
  Problem:    If you create a project with no supported language (either through
              the project properties editor or manually by setting the
              Languages attribute to the empty list), GPS will show "Ada" as
              supported the next time the project properties editor is open
  Workaround: Edit such projects by hand

- C424-007 Cannot copy-paste from the documentation
  Problem:    Copying part of the documentation through the contextual menu
              sometimes results in gtk+ warnings and some incorrect characters
              appearing when the text is pasted in an editor
  Workaround: Avoid selecting the navigation arrows in the documentation.
              ASCII text is correctly copied. Or read the manuals directly
              from an external browser

- gnat stub started with wrong project
  Problem:    When the menu Edit->Generate Body is selected, gnat stub fails
              executing because it cannot found the project
  Workaround: run gnat stub directly in a shell window

- Incorrect refresh of the project explorer when the project changes
  Problem:    If you change the project or the scenario variables, the project
              explorer's contents is refreshed, and all directories seem to
              contain files (there is a [+] on the left).
  Workaround: None needed, when you click on the +, it simply disappears.

- C326-004 Duplicate entries in dialog File->Open From Project
  Problem:    When using extending projects, duplicate source files might be
              displayed in this dialog (once for the original project and once
              for the extending project)
  Workaround: Click on any of the instance, they all point to the same file

- C312-002 Code correction error with CR/LF files
  Problem:    When using automatic code correction with files containing CR/LF
              line terminators, the correction is wrong.
  Workaround: Save the files in "unix" mode

- C305-012 Removed files are not displayed in the VCS Explorer.
  Problem:    When querying the status of files in a directory, the removed
              files do not appear in the VCS Explorer.
  Workaround: None.

- C129-010 Editing switches might result in duplicated lines in project
  Problem:    If you have edited a project manually, and specified upper-cased
              indexes for attributes like Default_Switches, GPS incorrectly
              detects them when overriding them through the GUI, and this
              results in duplicated lines in the project
  Workaround: No user-visible impact. However, you can use lower-case indexes
              to avoid this problem.

- C115-009 Added files not displayed in the VCS Explorer
  Problem:    When a file has been locally added but not committed to the
              repository, it appears as "Not registered".
  Workaround: None

Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.2.2

- Infinite loop in search dialog
  Problem:    In some cases, it might happen that looking for a constant string
              results in an infinite loop in GPS.
  Workaround: Click the Regexp button in the search dialog before starting the
              search
                                                                                
- C605-012 Editing read-only project file
  Problem:    When a project has been edited through the project properties
              dialog, and you try to save it but the file is read-only on the
              system, the save action is silently ignored
  Workaround: Avoid editing read-only projects. If in doubt, open the project
              file itself through the contextual menu and check that the
              editor doesn't report it as read-only
                                                                                
- C528-003 Changes to Ada tools in project properties not taken into account
  Problem:    Changing the name of the compiler or the debugger through the
              project properties editor is not properly taken into account
  Workaround: Modify the project manually (package Ide)
                                                                                
- C520-006 Location window raised unexpectedly
  Problem:    The location window is sometimes raised when manipulating the
              source editor even though no information is displayed in it.
  Workaround: Close the location window in such cases

- C519-020 GPS installation overrides system libraries under Linux
  Problem:    Under Linux, the GPS installation will incorrectly suggests
              /usr as the default base installation in case a version of
              gnat is found under this directory, overriding the system Gtk+
              libraries.
  Workaround: Specify explicitely a different path when installing GPS.

- C306-010 Incorrect handling of cygwin path in the debugger
  Problem:    Some versions of gdb generate references to cygwin mounted drives
              (e.g. /cygdrive/c), which is not handled properly by GPS.
  Workaround: Use a version of gdb that does not generate references to cygwin
              paths.

- C424-012 Cancel button not working under Windows in 'Save As' dialog
  Problem:    When using the 'Save As' dialog under Windows, the cancel button
              button is ignored, saving unconditionally the file.
  Workaround: Avoid using the cancel button when using this dialog.

Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.2.1

- C418-010 Messages window not saved in the desktop
  Problem:    When the desktop is saved, the location of the messages window
              is not saved.
  Workaround: It is possible to manually edit the file $HOME/.gps/desktop, but
              it is simpler to move the messages window back to the location
              where you want it on startup.
                                                                                
- C418-010 Incorrect desktop loading for location window
  Problem:    If the location window is put in the left dock, and the desktop
              is saved, then GPS won't be able to restore the desktop on startup              and will crash.
  Workaround: Edit the file $HOME/.gps/desktop by hand to remove the location
              window reference.

- C425-020 Selection in greyed out fields in the project properties editor
  Problem:    If Ada is not a supported language for your project, the combo
              boxes for the compiler and gnatls can still be selected by
              clicking on the arrow.
  Workaround: Avoid clicking on the arrow, although no arm will result if you
              do. The new setting is simply ignored when the project is saved.
                                                                                
- Extra dialog displayed during search
  Problem:    When starting a search from the beginning of a file, GPS will ask
              to restart from the beginning once the search reaches the end of
              the file and no occurrence is found.
  Workaround: Ignore the dialog.

- C428-027 Interactive Replace does not work.
  Problem:    When using the Search dialog to perform Replace operations on the
              current file, clicking the Replace button does not replace the
              text, but only skips to the next issue.
  Workaround: Use the "Replace all occurrences" mode.

- C422-016 Under Windows, the Directory Selection dialog raises error windows.
  Problem:    Under Windows, using the Directory Selection dialog might bring
              up error dialogs saying
                "There is no disk in the drive.
                 Please insert a disk into drive A:"
  Workaround: These errors can be safely ignored.

- C312-004 Under Windows, docking the Search dialog causes undesired resizing.
  Problem:    Under Windows only, when the Search dialog is docked and the
              main GPS window is maximized, pressing CTRL-F causes the GPS
              window to be un-maximized.
  Workaround: Do not maximize the GPS main window, make it manually as big
              as the desktop.

- C425-015 Tooltip flashing under Windows
  Problem:    Under Windows only, when you move the mouse on the menu
              Project->Recompute Project, a tooltip is displayed and
              immediately removed, continuousely.
  Workaround: Mouse the mouse to another menu item.

- C404-004 Dynamic menu key binding not working properly under Windows
  Problem:     Under Windows, when enabling the dynamic key binding feature,
               an extra <Shift> is always incorrectly detected when using
               <Control>-key.
  Workaround:  Edit the file .gps/custom_key directly.

Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.2.0

- C407-019 Cross-references fails for preprocessed files
  Problem:    When the Ada source files have been preprocessed directly by
              gnatmake, GPS cannot do cross-references from the corresponding
              source files.
  Workaround: Run gnatprep separately from gnatmake (ie don't use the -gnatep
              command line switch).

- C404-010 Bad indentation of task specs in some cases
  Problem:    The indentation engine will not properly parse task specs in
              the following cases: the task spec contains a pragma taking
              parameters as its first non comment line, e.g:

              task T is
                 pragma Storage_Size (2000);
                 entry E;
              end T;

  Workaround: Move the pragma after other declarations (e.g. after 'entry E'
              in the example above).

- C318-002 "Find All References" Menu is not working.
  Problem:    The global menu "Navigate->Find All References" does nothing.
  Workaround: Use the contextual menu "References->Find All References to".

- C324-007 Error executing custom actions with constant arguments
  Problem:    If a command specified in the custom file (to add a new menu)
              contains an argument that doesn't start with '%', that command is
              improperly executed.
  Workaround: Create a small wrapper script that doesn't need this constant
              argument, and call that script instead

- C326-002 GPS crashes changing Unit size in Memory View
  Problem:    When using the GPS memory view, switching the Unit Size might
              cause GPS to crash.
  Workaround: Inspect the memory using the "x" command of gdb.

- C312-005 Reloading current project kills all open windows
  Problem:    If you reopen (Project->Open or Project->Recent) the currently
              loaded project, GPS asks for saving the windows, and then closes
              all of them to reload the desktop.
  Workaround: Load another project before reloading the project.

- C312-013 Problem building with relative paths under Windows
  Problem:    Under Windows, when using projects with relative pathnames,
              if you change the current drive (by e.g. opening a file in
              another drive), the build will not succeed.
  Workaround: Use absolute paths in your project file, or use the menu
              File->Change Directory... before doing a build.

- Callgraph missing references with extended projects
  Problem:    If your project hierarchy is setup so that A extends B, then
              a callgraph for an entity of A will miss all calls done from
              source files only in B, and not overriden in A.
  Workaround: None found.

- Only two desktops can be saved
  Problem:    If there are already two desktops saved, saving a new one
              replaces the oldest of the existing two desktops by the new one.
  Workaround: copy ~/.gps/desktop as needed, and put the right version back
              just before launching GPS.

- C228-015 Command Make "All main subprograms" fails on Windows
  Problem:    The command make "All main subprograms" fails on Windows. GPS
              just report immediately "process exited with status -1".
  Workaround: Build all main procedures separately.

- Missing occurrences in search
  Problem:    In some case, the search algorithm was missing some occurrences
              of the string in the files.
  Workaround: Search for a regular expression instead.

- C228-002 Changes in project settings not taken into account immediately
  Problem:    If you modify the compiler name in the project properties editor,
              it isn't taken into account for the following compilation commands
  Workaround: Quit GPS and reload the project

- C222-002 Problem with save as null extension under Windows
  Problem:    Under Windows platforms only, when creating a file with no
              extension, a default .ads extension is always added.
  Workaround: Create an empty file with the right name outside of GPS, and
              then load it and edit it in GPS.

- No GPS window when unknown project specified on the command line
  Problem:    If a non-existing project file is specified on the command line
              with the -P parameter, the GPS window didn't appear on the screen
  Workaround: Make sure the file exists when specified on the command line

- OK button not selected in the "Open From Project" dialog the second time
  Problem:    When the dialog File->Open From Project is displayed, pressing
              enter will automatically open the file. However, this no longer
              worked the second time.
  Workaround: Press Alt+O instead

- C227-001 Last line of file not saved properly
  Problem:    In some cases when saving a file, the last character is
              truncated.
  Workaround: Add an extra blank line at the end of the file before saving it.

- C218-012 Drive letters not supported under Windows
  Problem:    The drive letters are not properly supported in the directory
              selector.
  Workaround: Change the current directory the the desired drive before using
              the directory selector, or type the full path directly.

- C216-001 Inconsistent behavior when exiting with unsaved files
  Problem:    If you have modified files and exit GPS, a confirmation dialog
              asking whether the files should be saved is displayed. If you
              cancel this dialog, and later exit GPS again, no dialog will
              be displayed for saving the modified file, unless the file has
              been modified again since the last exit. Similarly, the 'All'
              button will not work.
  Workaround: Save the file explicitely, or use the menu File->Save...->All
              before exiting.

- C130-023 Crash when opening multiple new files
  Problem:    When opening new files using the menu File->New or the
              toolbar icon, opening multiple new files when the line numbers
              are displayed causes GPS to crash.
  Workaround: In the preferences dialog, disable the "Display line numbers"
              preference in the Editor section.

- C128-002 Crash when searching in files containing CR characters
  Problem:    When searching in a file containing CR with no corresponding
              LF characters, GPS sometimes crashes or behaves in an unreliable
              way.
  Workaround: Save the file as Unix or Windows format.

- C117-005 Crash when adding lines in new file
  Problem:    When editing a new file while the line numbers are displayed,
              adding a few lines will cause GPS to crash.
  Workaround: Disable the "Display line numbers" preference.

- C116-002 Current line highlighting sometimes highlights multiple lines.
  Problem:    In some cases, for example when Reverting a file from the disk,
              the color that is used to highlight the current line is visible
              on multiple lines.
  Workaround: Scroll the editor or move the cursor to remove the extra
              highlighting.

- C105-001 Mismatch between files and VCS logs.
  Problem:    In some cases, the VCS log files do not correspond to the right
              files, or GPS cannot read the mapping file, and therefore
              cannot start.
  Workaround: Remove all the files in the log_files subdirectory in the GPS
              directory.

- Bad handling of item icon when saving new file
  Problem:    After saving an untitled file, the icon corresponding to the
              editor still shows the "modified" icon.
  Workaround: Save the file twice.

- Extended project nodes duplicated in explorer when recomputing view
  Problem:    If your project hierarchy includes extended project, and you
              select the menu Project->Recompute View, the extended project
              nodes are duplicated, and the exec directories disappear
  Workaround: Reload the project through Project->Recent instead

- BC04-009 Annoying scrolling when switching tabs
  Problem:    When switching from an editor to another, the editors scroll
              back to the place where their cursor is set, not to the point
              that was viewed the most recently.
  Workaround: Set the cursor within the viewed area before switching.

- Inconsistency between debugger dot colors when showing lines with code
  Problem:    When the debugger preference "show lines with code" is set,
              unsetting a breakpoint will leave a blue dot.
  Workaround: Always enable the "show lines with code" preference.
