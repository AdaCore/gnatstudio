Known Problems fixed in GPS 2.0.1

- D603-013 %pp in custom files incorrect expanded on Windows
  Problem:    If you use %pp in custome files on Windows, the backslashes
              are incorrectly quoted, and will be removed when the command is
              executed, resulting in an invalid file name
  Workaround: use  """%pp """ instead to be safe

- Initial selection in File View is not always the current directory
  Problem:    The directory initialy selected in the File View is not the
              current directory. Getting to the latter might require expanding
              nodes on Windows
  Workaround: Manually select the directory you want to access

- File View filters fail on Windows: Show Files From Project Only
  Problem:    The contextual menu's filter Show Files From Project Only
              doesn't work on windows, where only one directory is shown
  Workaround: Deactivate this filter, and scroll to the project's directory

- D603-010 Can't evaluate nested python commands
  Problem:    When you enter interactively a command in the python console,
              nested blocks (a if inside a while for instance), the command
              is never executed properly and results in an error
  Workaround: write the command in a file, and execute that file instead

- D602-016 Duplicate Build menu entries with extending projects
  Problem:    If you are using extending projects, the Build->Make menu
              will contain apparently duplicate entries.
  Workaround: In fact, these entries will build the same executable, but using
              a different project each time. Click on the first entry that
              matches the executable you want to build

- D601-005 To be completed ???

- D528-004 Directory names always absolute in project files on Windows
  Problem:    If you add directories to a project file through the "Edit
              project properties" dialog, the generated project file will in
              fact use absolute directory names on Windows
  Workaround: Edit the project file manually afterwards

- Color reset when changing the size of a font
  Problem:    When changing the size of a font in the preferences dialog,
              the foreground and background colors are reset to the default
              value (black/white).
  Workaround: Change again the color after having set the font size.

- D526-007 GPS hangs or crashes under Windows NT4 when loading some Ada file
  Problem:    Under Windows NT4, a memory corruption occurs when parsing
              some Ada constructs which hangs or crashes GPS.
  Workaround: This issue is speicfic to version 2.0.0. Using an more recent or
              old release is the only known safe work around

- File View only show files in the current directory on Windows
  Problem:    On Windows, the File View only show the files and subdirectories
              of the current directory.
  Workaround: Set the current directory to c:\, close and reopen the file view

- D505-015 Project Explorer is sometimes empty on Windows
  Problem:    The project explorer sometimes only show the directories of
              the project, but no source file, although these are still found
              when pressing File->Open From Project
  Workaround: Use all lower-cases for your directory names

- D527-011 Some errors no longer auto-fixable
  Problem:    If you compile multiple files with errors with the same command
              (for instance with make -k or gnatmake -k), some errors that
              are automatically fixable by clicking on the icon in the location
              window when a single file is compiled are no longer fixable.
  Workaround: Recompile each file with an error separately

- D604-014 Defining the same action multiple times crashes GPS
  Problem:    If you create the same action multiple times in your XML files
              through the <action> tag, GPS will misbehave or even crash
              when menus execute that action.
  Workaround: Make sure the actions are defined only once

- D601-008 Custom files: Incorrect handling of spaces in "switch" attribute
  Problem:    If you are defining a new tool in an XML file, GPS doesn't
              report an error if the switch contains a space, and fails in
              showing the project editor correctly
  Workaround: Remove the space, and use the "separator" attribute instead

- D527-012 Cannot load newly created project
  Problem:    When creating a project from GPS, using Project->New..., GPS
              will generate an error message when loading this project as
              part of the project creation.
  Workaround: The project file has been properly create on disk, so it can
              be loaded using Project->Open...

- D526-029 GPS slow due to excessive X-Window traffic under Solaris
  Problem:    Under some versions of Solaris and some remote X servers,
              the amount of network requests exchanged between GPS and the
              X server is high, making GPS very slow.
  Workaround: Set the GDK_USE_XFT environment variable to "0".

- D526-022 Custom switches pages not displayed in the project properties
  Problem:    When defining custom tools using XML files, if the tool is not
              defined as language-specific, the switches page is not shown
              in the project properties.
  Workaround: Add a child node <language>Ada</language> to the tool node.

- D526-010 GPS crash when using an empty custom external editor
  Problem:    When using a custom external editor and specifying no custom
              editor command, GPS will end unexpectedly.
  Workaround: Specify a non empty custom editor command.

- D524-004 Confusion on some preference tooltip
  Problem:    The tooltip displayed to describe some preferences use the
              words True/False while the preference dialog displays
              Enabled/Disabled which can be confusing.
  Workaround: Enabled always means True. Disabled always means False.

- D516-001 Bad handling of executable name with spaces when debugging
  Problem:    When loading an executable containing spaces in its pathname,
              the executable is not loaded properly.
  Workaround: Load the file manually by typing a load "file-name" command in
              debugger console.

- D512-014 Attach not recognized as an execution command
  Problem:    When typing an 'attach' command in the debugger console,
              the 'start/continue' button will perform a 'begin' instead of
              a 'continue' command.
  Workaround: Either using the Continue menu or type 'cont' in the console.

Known Problems fixed in GPS 2.0.0

- D511-008 Bad handling of caps lock key under Windows
  Problem:    Under Windows only, the caps lock key is equivalent to having
              the shift key pressed. In particular this means that numeric
              keys are not handled correctly.
  Workaround: Press the shift key when needed to get the correct key.

- D415-005 Execution window is read-only after the first execution
  Problem:    If you run an external program using the menu Build->Run,
              after the process exits, the execution window becomes read-only
              and cannot be used to input text in following executions of the
              program.
  Workaround: Close the execution window before executing the second time.

- Pretty_Printer package generated in projects even when not used
  Problem:    The project wizard will create a Pretty_Printer package, even if
              no switch was set by the user. This creates a problem with GNAT
              versions older than 3.16, which don't support this package
  Workaround: Edit the project file manually to remove the package

- "Find all references" fails for GNAT runtime entities
  Problem:    If you try to find all the places where an entity from the
              GNAT runtime is referenced, only the results in the runtime
              itself or the root project are returned.
  Workaround: Create a project file that describes the location of the runtime,
              and import it from all other projects in your project tree

- D301-004 Invalid references to entities with Ada generics
  Problem:    Find All References will sometimes give incorrect results for
              entities declared in a generic (line and columns are correct,
              but file names are incorrect).
  Workaround: None found.

- The log files in directory log_files/ are not removed on Windows
  Problem:    After editing and committing a file the log file is not removed
              from the %HOME%\.gps\log_files directory under Windows.
  Workaround: Remove the file manually after exiting GPS.

- D108-007 Main files listed in the project file must end with source extension
  Problem:    If the list of main units listed in the project file is the name
              of an executable instead of a source file, GPS doesn't recognize
              it.
  Workaround: Specify the list of main source files in your manually edited
              projects.

- D128-002 Absolute paths generated when adding project dependencies
  Problem:    When a new dependency is added between two projects, an absolute
              path is almost always generated, no matter what the preference
              "Relative project paths" is.
  Workaround: Edit the project properties, unset the "Paths should be
              relative", and press OK. Edit again the properties and set back
              the button.
              You can then save the project, and all absolute paths have been
              converted to absolute.

- CC18-008 GPS does not check the "read-only" state of files when using VCS
  Problem:    When using CVS in a mode where file are read-only when they are
              not explicitely opened, or when using ClearCase, GPS does not
              check the read-only/writable state of the file after operations
              such as open, check-in, check-out.
  Workaround: Manually click the "Writable/Read Only" area in the editor.

- Duplicate new file names
  Problem:    Creating several new files, and closing one that is not the last
              one, and creating a new one again result in a name duplication,
              and gets GPS confused.
  Workaround: Save the files as soon as possible. Added benefit is a proper
              recognition of the language.

- CC10-007 Opaque resizing of windows on Windows doesn't work
  Problem:    If you have set the opaque mode in the preferences, and try to
              resize the windows, then GPS moves them instead.
  Workaround: Select the non-opaque mode.

- CB20-010 Project wizard creates existing object directory
  Problem:    If you select "use relative paths" in the project wizard, it
              happens that GPS suggests the creation of the object or exec
              directories, even though they already exist.
  Workaround: Answer Cancel to the dialog

- CB18-012 Different behavior between VCS global and contextual menus.
  Problem:    When you use the global menu VCS->Query status for all projects,
              only the status for project source files are queried, whereas
              when using the corresponding contextual menu, the status for all
              files, including non-source files, in the project directories
              are queried.
- Workaround: Use the contextual menu if you want to query status for
              non-source files.

- CB06-006 Wrong file name suggested when saving a.b unit
  Problem:    When creating an Ada unit called e.g. "a.b", GPS suggests the
              name a-b.adb instead of a~b.adb.
  Workaround: Fix the name manually when saving it.

- Block folding not compatible with extended character sets
  Problem:    When a block contains extended characters, folding this block
              causes loss of text.
  Workaround: Do not use block folding on source files which contain
              extended characters.

- C915-006 Incorrect refresh of line numbers
  Problem:    Sometimes scrolling source editors up and down using the
              scrollbar cause line numbers to be incorrectly displayed.
  Workaround: Scrolling using the keyboard refreshes the line display.

- Debugger specified on the command line not used by 'Debug->Initialize'
  Problem:    When launching gps with the --debugger switch, creating
              new debugger using Debug->Initialize will not take this
              switch into account.
  Workaround: Edit the project properties to change the debugger command.

- The title of windows is not remembered from one session to another
  Problem:    When the Entities Browser, the Project Browser or the Dependency
              Browser is open, exiting GPS and restarting will create those
              browsers with no titles.
  Workaround: Close these windows and launch the browser in the usual fashion.
