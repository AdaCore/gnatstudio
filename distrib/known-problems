Known Problems fixed in GPS 3.2.0

- F106-014 GPS auto-casing does not support unicode characters
  Problem:    GPS was not properly changing the case of identifiers with
              unicode characters (like the Greek letter Pi for example).
  Workaround: Disable the auto-casing in the preferences or press ctrl-q
              before the space as this disable the auto-casing of last word.

- F104-007 GPS split MDI when opening log files
  Problem:    The log files are opened by splitting the MDI when using the
              Edit log file VCS command. When using the command
              Commit (via revision log) the MDI is not split, the file is
              placed with the consoles if possible. For consistency, this is
              now the new behavior for the Edit log file.
  Workaround: Move the log editor manually

- EC29-006 Wrong indentation of default generic procedures
  Problem:    The Ada editor does not correctly indent constructs such as
              generic
                 with procedure F is Y;
  Workaround: Fix indentation manually or use the "simple indentation" mode

- EC07-009 Leave focus on selected window in the bookmarks view
  Problem:    When you select an existing bookmark in the bookmarks view, the
              focus remains on the bookmark view instead of going to the
              associated editor.
  Workaround: Select the bookmark and then the editor

- EB28-007 Segmentation fault when closing a debug item
  Problem:    When closing a graphic item in the debug data window, a
              segmentation fault might be raised.
  Workaround: The problem is usually handled transparently by GPS, not
              causing visible issues.

- EB16-002 Wrong parenthesis highlighting
  Problem:    Parenthesis in comment are taken into account when doing the
              highlighting of matching parenthesis.
  Workaround: None
