Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.5.0

- IA21-005 Key Shortcuts editor dialog is now clearer
  Problem:    When you press Grab in the key shortcuts editor, you are left
              with a busy cursor with no obvious indication that GPS is
              waiting for input.
  Workaround: Press the new shortcut you wish to assign.

- I612-002 Name Parameters and dotted notation
  Problem:    When a primitive operation is called using the new Ada05
              dotted notation, the refactoring Name Parameter repeats the
              first parameter name (even though it is in fact given
              before the ".").
  Workaround: Change to standard call, do the renaming, and then back to
              the dotted notation.
