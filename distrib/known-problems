Known Problems fixed in GPS 3.1.0

- E708-005 International characters converted to local character set when saving
  Problem:    When saving files, GPS ignores the preference in Character Set
              and saves to the local character set.
  Workaround: Set the environment variable CHARSET to your preferred character
              set (for example UTF-8) 

- E708-004 Find Referemces... dialog returning unexpected references
  Problem:    The Find References... contextual menu opens a contextual menu
              where you can choose what kind of references should be returned.
              However, it happens that GPS returns other kinds in addition
  Workaround: Ignore the other types (since the kind is listed in the Locations
              window)

- E701-005 Crash/Freeze when closing a New View of an editor
  Problem:    When using multiple views of an editor, if the original view
              is closed before any of the other views, GPS might become
              unstable when closing the other views.
  Workaround: Always close the new views before closing the original view

- E617-006 Casing problem in the executable name when editing projects
  Problem:    If you use file names with upper cases in your project, GPS will
              convert these names to lower case in the project file when you
              specify an executable name for this main unit
  Workaround: manually edit your project file, or edit projects.xml to specify
              that the index is case sensitive for "executable"

- E606-009 Local_Pragma_File project property always saved as a base file name
  Problem:    When you edit the project properties, the location of the pragma
              file is always saved as a base name, instead of a relative or
              absolute path.
  Workaround: Edit projects.xml in the GPS installation to remove the
              base_file_name attribute

- E525-012 Pasting in the consoles
  Problem:    When using the system-defined method for pasting the clipboard
              (ie ctrl-v under Windows, or middle-button press under Unix) in
              the GPS consoles, the text is always appended at the end of the
              line.
  Workaround: Use the menu Edit->Paste or its associated key binding

- E308-016 Cannot initialize debugger under Tru64
  Problem:    In some cases, when initializing the debugger under Tru64,
              an error message is displayed in the debugger console such as:
              /dev/ptyrd: No such file or directory.
              /proc/380269: No such file or directory.
  Workaround: Disable the "Execution Window" preference in the Debugger section
