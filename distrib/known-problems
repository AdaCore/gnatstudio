Known Problems fixed in GPS 6.0.0 / GNATbench 2.8.0

- LC04-026: GPS: tooltips are blurry on Retina displays
  Problem:    GPS draws its tooltips (for instance in editors) by using
              pixmaps. This results in blurry text on high-dpi screens.
  Workaround: The text is readable even if a bit blurry.

- LB26-008: GPS: Smart completion of C/C++ parameters
  Problem:    When a function/method has several parameters, we press the
              open parenthesis, and we choose smart completion of all the
              parameters at once, then the number of added parameters added
              by GPS is correct but their names (shown as comments) is wrong.
  Workaround: Fix the name of the parameters manually.

- LB21-035: GPS: wrong &lt char in locations
  Problem:    In Location View text created through scripting API has
              escaped markup characters.
  Workaround: None.

- LB21-033: GPS: Codefix of expanded names in redundant conversions
  Problem:    Fixing automatically warnings on redundant type conversions
              fails if the target type is an expanded name (that is, when
              the target type has a prefix like "x.y.t").
  Workaround: Avoid automatically fixing the code when the warning is reported
              in an expanded name.

- LB14-054: GPS: keyboard shortcuts not functional when Caps Lock is active
  Problem:    When Caps Lock is active, letter-based keyboard shortcuts for
              GPS actions do not work.
  Workaround: Create a wrapper action, bound to the capitalized version of the
              letter.

- LB13-012: GPS: The contextual menu to close other editors has been removed
  Problem:    The contextual menu appearing on notebook tabs to close other
              editors has been removed.
  Workaround: Use the menu File -> Close All Editors Except Current instead.

- LA23-019: Bad indentation of access procedure type in generic declaration
  Problem:    When indenting code of the form:
              generic
                 type T is access procedure;
              The indentation engine gets confused and wrongly indents the
              following statements.
  Workaround: Fix the indentation manually.

- LA12-034: GPS: wrong menu for target with custom name in extending project
  Problem:    When using an extending project which defines an executable name
              for a main which is defined in the extended project, GPS does not
              display the custom name in the "Run" menu, and the corresponding
              target cannot be launched through the menu or the toolbar button.
  Workaround: Use the Build->Run->Custom... menu

- LA11-026: GPS: C/C++ completion of entities defined in header files
  Problem:    GPS does not propose a list of entities for completion when the
              type of the prefix is defined in a header file.

  Workaround: Include manually the file.

- LA11-003: No xref from separate units compiled explicitly
  Problem:    If you use separate Ada units, and compile them explicitly from
              the editor (for instance /Build/Compile File), then no
              cross-reference is available anymore for that file.
  Workaround: force the loading of all xref in memory, through
              /Build/Load Xref In Memory.
