Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.0.1

- Deleting scenario variables sometimes generates an incorrect project
  Problem:    When clicking on the trash button next to a scenario variable
              (at the top of the project explorer), this will sometimes
              report an internal error.
  Workaround: Try setting other values for the variable before removing it.
              Last chance is to edit the project by hand, or keep the variable
              around, but always modify all the possible values in the project
              properties editor.
