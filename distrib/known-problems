Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.4.0

- Internal error when looking for the body of Unchecked_Deallocation
  Problem:    If you right click on the work Unchecked_Deallocation in Ada
              mode, and ask for its body, an internal error is reported
  Workaround: Unchecked_Deallocation has no body, no need to look for it

- Words containing underscores not selected entirely when double-clicking
  Problem:    If you double-click on a word that contains an underscore, only
              part of the word is selected.
  Workaround: Select the word using a click-and-drag motion.

- Messages window not raised when initial project has errors
  Problem:    If you load from the command line a project file that contains
              errors, the Messages window is not raised to make them visible.
  Workaround: Switch to the Messages window manually

- Saving project with languages other than Ada doesn't always generate Makefile
  Problem:    If a project is importing another project that has languages
              other than Ada, no Makefile is generated for the project.
  Workaround: run gpr2make by hand

- A project with no source files couldn't be open in the Project View
  Problem:    If source directories were defined for the project, but no
              source file was found in them, the source directories couldn't
              be accessed through the explorer.
  Workaround: Use the Files View to access the directory

Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.3.0

- C611-012 Cross-references do not work with C under Solaris
  Problem:    Under some circumstances, on Solaris, the navigation in C/C++
              files does not work and displays the message "No cross-reference
              information found for (...)".
  Workaround: None.

- C703-014 Locations window is raised for every compiling message
  Problem:    When the compilation outputs many error/warning messages,
              the locations window is raised above the messages window with
              every new error.
  Workaround: Move the locations window or the messages window to another part
              of the MDI.

- C703-005 Pasting text from the clipboard doesn't overwrite the selection
  Problem:    If you are doing an interactive search, replacing the text using
              the keyboard shortcut for "Paste" doesn't replace the selected
              text.
  Workaround: Use the Search/Replace interface.

- C627-007 Exec directory settings lost when editing project properties
  Problem:    If you have specified a relative path for the executables
              directory and you edit the project properties, it can happen
              that the executables directory is corrupted if the current
              directory has changed.
  Workaround: Either use absolute paths for the executables directory, or
              make sure the current directory is the one containing the
              project file before you edit the project properties.

- C626-007 Extra blank lines in messages window under Windows
  Problem:    When running external processes (e.g. using a custom file)
              that output CR/LF line terminators, extra blank line are
              displayed in the messages window.
  Workaround: Add a wrapper around the external process that transforms
              CR/LF into LF.

- C625-002 Debugger breakpoints not always appearing in the GPS source editor
  Problem:    When in debugger mode, setting a breakpoint by clicking on the
              dots in the editor does not always display a breakpoint icon.
  Workaround: The breakpoint is active even if it's not displayed. To delete
              it, type "delete <number of the breakpoint>" in the debugger
              console.

- C618-002 Font size changes under Windows when highlighting Messages window
  Problem:    Under Windows, when the Messages window gets some output
              and does not have the focus, the size of the title font is
              changed, in addition to the change of color
  Workaround: None

- C616-002 Incorrect handling of relative exec directories
  Problem:    If the executable directory was defined as a relative path in
              the project file, then GPS will not be able to run or debug
              the executable
  Workaround: Change the current directory with File->Change Directory to be
              the one that contains the project file before doing a run or a
              debug.

- C611-001 Protection domain entry not accessible in GPS
  Problem:    The Protection Domains entry in the Debug->Data menu
              is not enabled for AE debuggers.
  Workaround: Use the gdb console to view and switch protection
              domains: "info pds" and "pd <pd_id>" respectively.

- C605-005 Duplicate key bindings in Build menu
  Problem:    If you are using an extending project, then the build menu
              (Build->Make) will contain an entry for the executables from
              the project and its parent, but both entries will have the same
              key shortcut associated with them.
  Workaround: use the contextual menu on projects in the project explorer to
              select which executable you want to build.

- C605-003 Key binding not reset when new project loaded
  Problem:    Some of the key bindings are incorrectly reset when a new
              project is loaded. For instance, if you have set a keybinding
              for Build->Make->All Main Units, and then load a new project,
              pressing a key will still build the units of the old project.
  Workaround: Select the menu with the mouse instead of using the key

- C604-004 Switching windows with Ctrl+<key> doesn't allow typing characters
  Problem:    On windows, using control-<key> to switch between windows
              disables the possibility to select windows by typing their names
  Workaround: Use the Window menu to switch between windows

- C513-008 Untitled files saved in desktop
  Problem:    When saving a desktop GPS will improperly save untitled files,
              and generate an error when trying to load the desktop.
  Workaround: Close or save untitled files before saving the desktop, or
              manually edit the file ~/.gps/desktop

- C511-002 Project not recomputed after using "save as"
  Problem:    When a file is saved with "save as", the file doesn't appear
              immediately in the project view, and will not be loaded correctly
              if it contains compilation errors
  Workaround: Select the menu Project->Recompute Project after saving

- C509-003 Incorrect expansion of -gnatVa compiler switch
  Problem:    If your project used -gnatVa, and you edit the compiler switches
              through the project properties editor, none of the check boxes
              in Validity Checkin are selected
  Workaround: Select the boxes you wish to activate. This just impacts the
              initial value.

- C508-012 Main units from extended projects now displayed in Debug->Initialize
  Problem:    The main units defined in some extended projects are not
              shown in the Debug->Initialize, although they are displayed in
              the Build->Make menu
  Workaround: Initialize the debugger with no main unit, and then load the
              executable you wish to debug through Debug->Debug->Load File

- C504-003 Alias file not saved properly under Windows
  Problem:    In some cases, extra CR character are improperly printed when
              saved the aliases under Windows.
  Workaround: Remove the extra CR characters in the file %HOME%\.gps\aliases

- C501-006 Child projects cannot be edited graphically
  Problem:    When a child project (ie whose name has a '.') is edited through
              the project properties editor, it cannot be saved afterwards.
  Workaround: Either edit the project manually, or save it under a new name and
              rename it afterwards

- C501-004 Incorrect naming scheme when saving new Ada file
  Problem:    When you save a newly created Ada file, the suggested default
              name used the GNAT naming scheme (.adb and .ads), instead of
              the root project's
  Workaround: Override the default value with the proper name

- Incorrect placement of cursor after insertion of <return>
  Problem:    When auto-indentation is actived and one presses <return> in the
              middle of a line, the cursor ends up at the end of the second
              line instead of the beginning
  Workaround: Press <home> just after <return>

- C429-010 Automatic Uncomment Lines operations sometimes fail.
  Problem:    When uncommenting Ada lines that only contain "--", or lines
              starting with spaces, with less than two spaces after "--",
              the line is not uncommented.
  Workaround: Uncomment those lines manually.

- C428-025 Read-only editors can be modified by internal actions.
  Problem:    When an editor is set as read-only, its contents can still be
              modified by actions such as undo/redo or automatic code fixing.
  Workaround: Do not use undo/redo or automatic code fixing on read-only
              files.

- C425-019 Handling of projects with no supported language
  Problem:    If you create a project with no supported language (either through
              the project properties editor or manually by setting the
              Languages attribute to the empty list), GPS will show "Ada" as
              supported the next time the project properties editor is open
  Workaround: Edit such projects by hand

- C424-007 Cannot copy-paste from the documentation
  Problem:    Copying part of the documentation through the contextual menu
              sometimes results in gtk+ warnings and some incorrect characters
              appearing when the text is pasted in an editor
  Workaround: Avoid selecting the navigation arrows in the documentation.
              ASCII text is correctly copied. Or read the manuals directly
              from an external browser

- gnat stub started with wrong project
  Problem:    When the menu Edit->Generate Body is selected, gnat stub fails
              executing because it cannot found the project
  Workaround: run gnat stub directly in a shell window

- Incorrect refresh of the project explorer when the project changes
  Problem:    If you change the project or the scenario variables, the project
              explorer's contents is refreshed, and all directories seem to
              contain files (there is a [+] on the left).
  Workaround: None needed, when you click on the +, it simply disappears.

- C326-004 Duplicate entries in dialog File->Open From Project
  Problem:    When using extending projects, duplicate source files might be
              displayed in this dialog (once for the original project and once
              for the extending project)
  Workaround: Click on any of the instance, they all point to the same file

- C312-002 Code correction error with CR/LF files
  Problem:    When using automatic code correction with files containing CR/LF
              line terminators, the correction is wrong.
  Workaround: Save the files in "unix" mode

- C305-012 Removed files are not displayed in the VCS Explorer.
  Problem:    When querying the status of files in a directory, the removed
              files do not appear in the VCS Explorer.
  Workaround: None.

- C115-009 Added files not displayed in the VCS Explorer
  Problem:    When a file has been locally added but not committed to the
              repository, it appears as "Not registered".
  Workaround: None
