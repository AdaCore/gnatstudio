Known Problems fixed in GPS 3.2.0

- F106-014 GPS auto-casing does not support unicode characters
  Problem:    GPS was not properly changing the case of identifiers with
              unicode characters (like the Greek letter Pi for example).
  Workaround: Disable the auto-casing in the preferences or press ctrl-q
              before the space as this disable the auto-casing of last word.

- F104-007 GPS split MDI when opening log files
  Problem:    The log files are opened by splitting the MDI when using the
              Edit log file VCS command. When using the command
              Commit (via revision log) the MDI is not split, the file is
              placed with the consoles if possible. For consistency, this is
              now the new behavior for the Edit log file.
  Workaround: Move the log editor manually

- F103-012 Loading new project breaks the desktop
  Problem:    If you load a project through the menu Project->Recent or
              Project->Load, the desktop is improperly updated, and some
              windows have unexpected sizes
  Workaround: Use the -P command line parameter to GPS to specify the
              project directly on the command line.

- EB16-002 Wrong parenthesis highlighting
  Problem:    Parenthesis in comment are taken into account when doing the
              highlighting of matching parenthesis.
  Workaround: None
