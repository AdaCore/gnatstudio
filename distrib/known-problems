Known Problems fixed in GPS 2.0.0

- C915-006 Incorrect refresh of line numbers
  Problem:    Sometimes scrolling source editors up and down using the
              scrollbar cause line numbers to be incorrectly displayed.
  Workaround: Scrolling using the keyboard refreshes the line display.

- Debugger specified on the command line not used by 'Debug->Initialize'
  Problem:    When launching gps with the --debugger switch, creating
              new debugger using Debug->Initialize will not take this
              switch into account
  Workaround: Edit the project properties to change the debugger command

- The title of windows is not remembered from one session to another.
  Problem:    When the Entities Browser, the Project Browser or the Dependency
              Browser is open, exiting GPS and restarting will create those
              browsers with no titles.
  Workaround: Close these windows and launch the browser in the usual fashion.
