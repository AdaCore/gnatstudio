Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.4.0

- I421-009: Scenario variables with non-static default values
  Problem:    When loading a project with scenario variables whose default
              value is not a static string (a concatenation, or the value of
              another scenario variable for instance), GPS fails to load
              properly.
  Workaround: use static values for scenario variables for now

- I415-009: Generate python doc with read-only install dir
  Problem:    When the GPS installation directory is read-only (as it should
              be to avoid overwriting files by mistake), you can only generate
              the python documentation (/Help/Python Extensions) once, and
              will generate errors the second time on.
  Workaround: Make the files share/gps/plug-ins/*.png read-write in the
              installation directory.

- I414-019: Buffer read/write status not properly updated
  Problem:    If the writable status is changed by an external tool
              (ClearCase for example) it is not always refreshed on
              the buffer status line.
  Workaround: Close and re-open the corresponding buffer.

- I326-017: Cannot build when opening a project using UNC path
  Problem:    When opening a project using UNC path (\\server\share) it is
              not possible to use the GPS builder module.
  Workaround: Mount the remote share with a drive letter.

- I313-019: "Remove Category" removes highlighting for all references
  Problem:    When multiple references in the Locations window are present,
              "Remove Category" removes the highlighting of all the other
	      references. The references still work when clicked, but the
              highlighting is missing.
  Workaround: This can be safely ignored.

- I310-028: Messages informing of creation of directories for each build mode
  Problem:    When loading GPS with a Build Mode set to something other than
              "default", GPS will create subdirectories in the object
              directories for every other build mode.
  Workaround: These directories are harmless, so the message can be safely
              ignored.

- I304-009: Better sorting on the revision view
  Problem:    The dates and revision numbers were not properly sorted.
              (using an alphabetical comparison for Subversion numbers for
              example). This problem is VCS dependent.
  Workaround: Do not sort on those columns. The default sort is chronological.

- I302-022: Cloning a target does not take into account the Category field
  Problem:    When cloning a target, the field 'Category' is not taken into
              account: the new target is created in the same category as the
              original target.
  Workaround: Exit GPS, and then modify the file "targets.xml" in the .gps
              directory manually.

- I226-002: Problem when loading desktop that contains a browser
  Problem:    When loading GPS, if the saved desktop contains a browser (such
              as the Debugger Data view or a Call graph Browser for instance),
              GPS might crash when loading.
  Workaround: Remove the "desktop.xml" file from the .gps directory.

- I217-007: Incorrect width computation in entity browser
  Problem:    The width of boxes in the entity browser was sometimes
              incorrect, resulting in truncated columns
  Workaround: Most of the time the name of the type is still readable, and
              otherwise you can click on the link to expand a new box for
              the type itself

- I205-006: Problems when manipulating non-utf8 paths
  Problem:    Parts of GPS (like the Project View) do not fully support
              paths that contain international characters which are not
              valid UTF-8.
  Workaround: Rename the directories.

- I202-039: Smart completion window behavior when scrolling
  Problem:    The smart completion window stays open when scrolling the editor,
              which can make it difficult to read text. Also, this causes the
              first click on the editor to scroll back to the place where the
              completion window was invoked.
  Workaround: Click once to cancel the smart completion window.

- I126-024: Creation of corrupted XML files when using international characters
  Problem:    When manipulating file system paths that contain international
              characters, GPS might create invalid XML files.
  Workaround: Avoid working in directories that contain international
              characters, and remove the invalid XML files from the .gps
              directory.

- I125-003: Syntax highlighting confused by search matches
  Problem:    The presence of extra highlighting in the editor (such as the
              highlighting of search matches) may cause GPS to miss some
              syntax highlighting.
  Workaround: This can be safely ignored, and goes away when the search matches
              (or other extra highlighting) are removed.

- I120-033: && should be "and then" not correctly auto-fixed
  Problem:    The auto-fix made for messages such as "&& should be "and then""
              is incorrect, it adds an unexpected quote at the location of the
              fix.
  Workaround: Manually delete the extra quote.

- I117-011: Fail to commit activities on Windows
  Problem:    GPS could fail to commit activities using Cygwin/Subversion
              on Windows when a filename is passed on the command line with
              the wrong casing. Windows is non case-sensitive but keeps
              filename casing. Using different casing for the pathname
              confuses Cygwin/Subversion which checks that all files, part
              of a group commit, are all under the same repository.
  Workaround: Make sure that proper casing is used on GPS command-line.

- I115-004: Location View: "secondary" locations attached to wrong node
  Problem:    When the compiler emits information concerning the same line
              and same column in two different files, GPS might place the
              "secondary" locations (ie, the locations line containing the
              hyperlink to the referenced file) on the node corresponding to
              the wrong file.
  Workaround: Read the compiler messages from the Messages window.

- I114-032: Big memory footprint at startup
  Problem:    When GPS starts, it already uses a lot of memory. Some analysis
              Showed that a good chunk of it was from loading the
              $HOME/.gps/properties.xml file in memory in an inefficient
              datastructure
  Workaround: remove or cleanup this file once in a whiile. It will not get
              very big unless you are using the filepos.py plugin

- I113-033: Unexpected scrolling when switching between views of same file
  Problem:    If you have two views of the same file side by side, and scroll
              one of them so that its cursor is no longer visible, then click
              inside the other one, the latter gets scrolled randomly and the
              cursor is not moved to the line you clicked on
  Workaround: scroll back to that line

- HC10-015: Wrong text replacement with auto-casing
  Problem:    When auto-casing is enabled in the preferences, the wrong
              text replacement can occur if there are single quotes in the text
              being considered.
  Workaround: Edit the wrong replacement manually.

- HC09-008: Bad handling of --display
  Problem:    The command line switch --display is not handled correctly by GPS
  Workaround: Set the environment variable DISPLAY instead. If you need to
              spawn applications from GPS to another display, you can write
              a small python plug-in that does:
                  import os; os.environ["DISPLAY"]="..."

- HA29-005: Block folding/unfolding broken with blank lines
  Problem:    If you use the GPS shell/python command "Editor.add_blank_lines"
              to add a blank line right after a line which starts a foldable
              block, and then fold this block, text corruption might occur in
              the current editor.
  Workaround: Do not use Editor.add_blank_lines in combination with block
              folding.

- HA07-008: Discrepencies between GPS and gprbuild
  Problem:    The list of source files reported by GPS and seen by gprbuild
              do not always match for languages other than Ada. This was
              fixed by using the same project manager in both tools.
              However, this change has a few minor impacts on some aspects
              of GPS: when a project is automatically generated with
              --debug, it no longer shows the runtime files in the Project
              View, nor the binder files (b~*.adb)
  Workaround: You can in fact open any file in GPS through /File/Open, so
              this issue is not blocking

- H624-007: Outline View slow on huge files
  Problem:    When displaying huge files (10000 significant lines of code or
              more), the Outline View introduces slowdowns in GPS.
  Workaround: Close the Outline View when working on big files.

- GC24-014: Auto-fix not ideal whem fixing "missing =>" or "missing :="
  Problem:    When fixing messages like "missing =>", the fix performed by
              the auto fix does not add a space before the arrow.
  Workaround: Manually add the space.

- F927-006: Folded blocks are deleted too easily
  Problem:    If a block is folded, pressing "backspace" when the cursor is at
              the beginning of the line following the folded block will delete
              the entire folded block.
  Workaround: Use Undo to go back to previous state.

- EC12-010: Too many navigation locations stored.
  Problem:    In some cases, multiple locations in the same area are stored
              by GPS. As a result, GPS remains on the same location when
              pressing the "Back" button multiple times.
  Workaround: Press Back/Forward multiple times, or use other means of
              navigation.

- E721-004: Lines cannot be removed after removing blank lines
  Problem:    When an editor has "blank lines" (for instance when the editor
              is part of a visual comparison), after these blank lines are
              removed, some line breaks might be left read-only, making it
              impossible to remove it using the backspace/delete keys.
  Workaround: Close the editor and reopen it.
