Known Problems fixed in GPS 3.1.2

- F209-018 Manually added -gnatw? switches are silently removed
  Problem:    In the project properties editor, if you manually add some
              switches that start with -gnatw for the Ada compiler (for
              instance -gnatwY), they might be silently deleted the next
              time the project properties are edited
  Workaround: Edit manually the file ada_support.xml in the GPS installation
              to add the switch you want (this should be done for instance by
              copying the line for "-gnatwv")

- F210-013 GPS goes in an infinite loop when displaying a tooltip
  Problem:    When trying to display a tooltip if the line just before the
              entity pointed by the mouse is blank but contains several
              characters (' ', horizontal tabulations, etc.) gps may end up
              stuck in an infinite loop.
  Workaround: Disable the Editor tooltip preference

- F207-018 Wrong translation in generated SVG
  Problem:    In some cases after some items in a graph have been moved
              (resulting in a change in the scrolling adjustments) the SVG
              representation of the graph contains a wrong translation.
              The result is that interesting part of the graph are rendered
              out of the sreen by an SVG plugin.
  Workaround: Edit the generated SVG file and change the sign of the x and/or
              y coordinate of the top level translation.
              Another alternative is simply to adjust the zooming level and/or
              scroll the rendered SVG in order to center interesting parts
              of the graph on the screen.

- F207-016 Examine Entity missing some values for enumerations
  Problem:    If you click on an enumeration type, and select "Examine Entity"
              in the contextual menu, the enumeration literals defined on the
              same line as the closing parenthesis are ignored
  Workaround: put the closing parenthesis on a line of its own

- F128-008 GPS does not always color lines correctly
  Problem:    After some characters have been added on a line, the line is
              not always correctly re-highlighted. This happens when inserting
              a single line comment mark or a string delimiter for example.
  Workaround: You can ignore this visual glitch

- EC29-006 Wrong indentation of default generic procedures
  Problem:    The Ada editor does not correctly indent constructs such as
              generic
                 with procedure F is Y;
  Workaround: Fix indentation manually or use the "simple indentation" mode

- EC07-009 Leave focus on selected window in the bookmarks view
  Problem:    When you select an existing bookmark in the bookmarks view, the
              focus remains on the bookmark view instead of going to the
              associated editor.
  Workaround: Select the bookmark and then the editor

- Hooks created in python cannot be run
  Problem:    If you use GPS.Hook.register in a python script to create a new
              hook, you cannot call GPS.Hook.run for this hook afterward, and
              GPS complains that the first argument must be a string.
  Workaround: Use standard function calls instead of hooks

Known Problems fixed in GPS 3.1.1

- F117-010 Crash when using "goto declaration or body"
  Problem:    GPS crashes each time the "goto declaration or body" action is
              invoked. A Storage_Error is raised. There is a similar issue with
              the "goto other file" action.
  Workaround: Use contextual menus or other actions such as
              "/Navigate/Goto Body", "/Navigate/Goto Declaration" or
              "/Navigate/Goto File Spec<->Body".

- F111-008 Seach contextual menu not set to proper context
  Problem:    When the project explorer is selected and the seach window opened,
              the look in area is not set to proper value, and has
              "Current File" instead of "Project Explorer"
  Workaround: Set manually "Project Explorer" in the look in area

- F109-009 Change in number of arguments to Editor.save
  Problem:    The obsolescent shell function Editor.save is declared as
              accepting no parameter, when in fact it accepts two and is
              documented as such.
  Workaround: use EditorBuffer.save instead

- EC29-002 Undesired input focus jumps in project wizard
  Problem:    In the project wizard, in the first page, if the first entry
              is empty, typing into the second entry causes the input focus
              to be given to the first entry.
  Workaround: Type something in the first entry, or use the "Browse" button

- EC28-009 GPS under Windows leaks some handles
  Problem:    On Windows GPS leaks one file handle, one process handle and one
              thread handle for each external command launched. This can lead
              to some instabilities after a long run.
  Workaround: Restart GPS from time to time

- EC20-019 Comment extraction before entities declarations under Windows
  Problem:    When pointing an entity declared in a file containing Windows
              line terminators, the comment extracted is the first one
              following the entity declaration which is most of the time not
              accurate.
  Workaround: Put the comment associated with an entity right after its
              declaration.

- EC20-017 Loading an application on the debugger under VxWorks does not work
  Problem:    When using Debug->Initialize-><main unit> using a VxWorks,
              the executable associated with the main unit is not loaded.
  Workaround: Use the menu Debug->Debug->Load File... to load the file manually

- EC19-008 Keyboard focus on notebook tab prevents compilation of current file
  Problem:    When you select the notebook tab associated with an editor, the
              menu Build->Make->Compile File no longer works for the select
              file.
  Workaround: Select the file by clicking anywhere inside the editor first

- EC15-014 Freeze when comparing files using the VCS
  Problem:    On Windows, GPS was sometimes freezing when launching multiple
              VCS diff operations.
  Workaround: Use the VCS from the command line

- EC07-015 Sorting Ascending/Descending problem with empty selection
  Problem:    Where there is no line selected the commands Sort Ascending and
              Sort Descending are not working properly. In this case, the sort
              should do nothing instead of swapping some characters.
  Workaround: Sort the lines manually

- EB22-005 Reset switches for a file to default leaves the attribute in project
  Problem:    If you open the Project->Edit File Switches, and reset the
              switches for one of the files to the default value, an entry is
              still left in the project file. Further changes to the default
              switches are not reflected for this file
  Workaround: Edit the project file manually

Known Problems fixed in GPS 3.1.0

- EB22-001 Replace does not work well on files containing TABs
  Problem:    When using the Replace feature, some occurrences of the search
              pattern might be skipped, in files containing TABs.
  Workaround: Remove the TABs before using the Replace feature.

- EB01-006 Search dialog doesn't warn when no occurrence found
  Problem:    Start searching in a file when there is no match. You get a dialog
              indicating there is no match. Then switch to another file, and
              press "Search next" again. The dialog is not displayed again even
              when there is no match.
  Workaround: If the editor doesn't scroll, it indicates there is no match

- EA28-010 Unwanted scrolling when using Undo/Redo
  Problem:    When an Undo/Redo causes lines in the editor to be added or
              removed, some unwanted scrolling can occur, causing the cursor
              to be placed in the center of the editor.
  Workaround: This visual glitch can be ignored

- EA27-003 Pretty printer now working when using a cross-compiler
  Problem:    GPS always assumes that you have a native installation of GNAT
              on your machine, and therefore that it can find the "gnat" tool.
  Workaround: Edit the .xml files (e.g. gnatpp.xml) in gps/share/plug-ins

- EA12-008 Debug contextual menu shows ".all" too often
  Problem:    When you have started the debugger, if you select more than an
              entity and right click in the selected text, the contextual menu
              will have choices to display "text.all", instead of just "text"
  Workaround: Type the "graph display" command in the debugger console directly

- EA06-022 Contextual menus sometimes disappear under Windows
  Problem:    Under Windows, when creating a contextual menu using a short
              right-click, the menu might disappear immediately. This occurs
              most often when clicking for the first time on an entity in a
              file editor.
  Workaround: Open the contextual menu by keeping the right button pressed

- EA06-005 Saving new file incorrectly sets the language
  Problem:    If you create a new file and save it, then start typing, the
              text is incorrectly highlighted because the language of the file
              has not been detected correctly.
  Workaround: Reload the project through Project->Recent

- EA06-002 Duplicate entries in Locations view after a search
  Problem:    If you do a Search for all occurrences twice for the same pattern,
              duplicate references are inserted into the Locations view.
  Workaround: Clear the locations view before starting the search

- E920-001 GPS installation conflicts with GtkAda installation
  Problem:    Both these tools install libgtkada.so on Unix platforms. If their
              version do not match, there might be conflicts either when
              running GPS or when compiling GtkAda applications
  Workaround: Install GPS in a separate directory

- E915-005 Version Control -> compare between two revisions doesn't work
  Problem:    The Version Control action to query a difference between two
              revisions of a file always returns "no differences found",
              without prompting a dialog to input the two revisions.
  Workaround: Query the differences using the command-line

- E911-003 Fixing "missing constant" error does not work under Windows
  Problem:    Under Windows, fixing automatically errors concerning missing
              constant keyword does not do anything.
  Workaround: Apply the fix manually

- E908-013 Bad indentation of "procedure xxx is null" construct
  Problem:    When parsing the Ada 2005 construct "procedure xxx is null;"
              GPS will incorrectly add an extra level of indentation
  Workaround: Fix the indentation by hand, or avoid this construct

- E908-004 Mouse button unresponsive on "File changed on disk" dialog
  Problem:    Under some circumstances, when files are changed on the disk,
              when switching editors by clicking on their notebook tabs, the
              buttons on the "File changed on disk" dialog do not respond to
              mouse click.
  Workaround: Use the keyboard to activate the buttons (Tab to select, Enter
              to activate)

- E831-001 Replace does not work on multiple-line searches
  Problem:    When using Search/Replace on a multiple-line search pattern, the
              "Replace" button does not cause the selected match to be
              overwritten.
  Workaround: Replace manually, using copy-paste for example

- E826-002 Unwanted resizing when closing the search dialog on Windows
  Problem:    If the search dialog is floating, closing it will resize other
              windows in GPS
  Workaround: Unfloat the dock. It is conveniently put above the project view
              for instance, so that it is always visible

- E822-004 Bad indentation of arrows in case of nested parentheses
  Problem:    When using the "align association on arrows" preference and
              indenting a complex expression with multiple parentheses, GPS
              will sometimes wrongly align the arrows.
  Workaround: Disable the "align association on arrows" preference

- E727-022 Right-click in single-line selection cancels it
  Problem:    If you have selected part of a line, and right-click in it to
              display the contextual menu, the selection is cancelled. As a
              result, the action can no longer rely on the selection (for
              instance if you have put Cut/Copy/Paste in the contexual menu).
  Workaround: None

- E708-005 International characters converted to local character set when saving
  Problem:    When saving files, GPS ignores the preference in Character Set
              and saves to the local character set.
  Workaround: Set the environment variable CHARSET to your preferred character
              set (for example UTF-8)

- E708-004 Find References... dialog returning unexpected references
  Problem:    The Find References... contextual menu opens a contextual menu
              where you can choose what kind of references should be returned.
              However, it happens that GPS returns other kinds in addition.
  Workaround: Ignore the other types (the kind is listed in the Locations
              window)

- E701-005 Crash/Freeze when closing a New View of an editor
  Problem:    When using multiple views of an editor, if the original view
              is closed before any of the other views, GPS might become
              unstable when closing the other views.
  Workaround: Always close the new views before closing the original view

- E620-006 Project icon modified even when cancelling saving
  Problem:    If you are working with the default project created by GPS, and
              try to save it, a dialog is displayed to ask for the name you
              would like to use. Clicking Cancel doesn't save the project, but
              no longer display the "modified" icon in the Project View
  Workaround: Try to save the project again if needed

- E617-006 Casing problem in the executable name when editing projects
  Problem:    If you use file names with upper cases in your project, GPS will
              convert these names to lower case in the project file when you
              specify an executable name for this main unit.
  Workaround: Manually edit your project file, or edit projects.xml to specify
              that the index is case sensitive for "executable".

- E606-010 GPS is unable to read files from disk after a long period
  Problem:    In a project that contains a lot of C/C++ files, or when working
              extensively with C/C++ files, GPS can besome unable to open new
              files.
  Workaround: Close GPS and restart

- E606-009 Local_Pragma_File project property always saved as a base file name
  Problem:    When you edit the project properties, the location of the pragma
              file is always saved as a base name, instead of a relative or
              absolute path.
  Workaround: Edit projects.xml in the GPS installation to remove the
              base_file_name attribute.

- E525-012 Pasting in the consoles
  Problem:    When using the system-defined method for pasting the clipboard
              (i.e. ctrl-v under Windows, or middle-button press under Unix) in
              the GPS consoles, the text is always appended at the end of the
              line.
  Workaround: Use the menu Edit->Paste or its associated key binding

- E523-021 Bad block highlighting on accept statement
  Problem:    GPS will incorrectly display the current block for an accept
              statement, starting at the 'do' keyword instead of starting
              at the 'accept' keyword
  Workaround: This is only a visual glitch that can be ignored. Indentation
              will not be affected.

- E503-024 Missing xref in C++
  Problem:    Some cross-reference contextual menus are missing when clicking
              on an entity in the spec file. When clicking on the same entity
              in the .c file, and then in the spec file, provides more menus,
              like the body.
  Workaround: Click in the .c file whenever possible instead of the .h file

- E308-016 Cannot initialize debugger under Tru64
  Problem:    In some cases, when initializing the debugger under Tru64,
              an error message is displayed in the debugger console such as:
              /dev/ptyrd: No such file or directory.
              /proc/380269: No such file or directory.
  Workaround: Disable the "Execution Window" preference in the Debugger section

- E223-016 Crash on menubar under Windows
  Problem:    When navigating in the menu bar using the keyboard, GPS will
              crash under Windows when moving to/from the last menu item.
  Workaround: Use the mouse to navigate in the menu bar instead

- D709-012 Cannot use Debug->Interrupt under Solaris 9
  Problem:    Under Solaris 9, after running the program being debugged, the
              program can not be halted using the Debug->Interrupt menu.
  Workaround: Under a shell, use the "kill -INT <gdb process>" command to
              simulate an interrupt to the debugger.
