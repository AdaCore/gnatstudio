Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.4.0

- HB21-038: Impossible to use native Win32 aspell program.
  Problem:    GPS seems to hand when using native Win32 aspell program and
              will never report any spelling errors.
  Workaround: Use a Cygwin version of aspell.

- HB17-006: Wrong coverage highlighting
  Problem:    GPS doesn't update the list of uncovered lines in the locations
	      window after reloading coverage information for a single file.
	      As a side effect covered lines may be highlighted as uncovered
              lines.
  Workaround: Hide and show coverage information for the file using the source
	      editor's contextual menu after reloading coverage information.

- HB13-014: Cannot load files with NUL characters
  Problem:    GPS ignores characters beyond a NUL character when loading
              a source file in an editor. It will now strip the NUL character
              and take into account the reamining file contents.
  Workaround:  Remove the NUL characters before loading the file in GPS.

- HB04-009: Debugger console has no keyboard focus on title click
  Problem:    If you click in the title bar or the tab of the debugger
              console, the cursor is not activated in the console, and
              you need to click inside it before typing
  Workaround: Click in the middle of the console to give it focus

- D502-003: Procedure name too long and overlap with VCS status
  Problem:    On the editor's status bar if a procedure name is
              too long it will overlap with the VCS status.
  Workaround: Use the VCS Explorer which displays the proper status
