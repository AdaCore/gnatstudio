Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.5.0

- IC01-004 Issues with project switching
  Problem:    When switching from a project A to a project B within GPS (for
              instance through the menu Project->Open...), GPS might be unable
              to load completely the new project B if it contains a scenario
              variable that has the same name as a variable in project A, but
              the value of that variable in project A is not a valid value in
              the context of project B.
  Workaround: Instead of switching within GPS, close GPS and re-open it on
              project B.

- IB06-021 No xref when Source_Dirs contains unresolved links
  Problem:    If you have used absolute paths in the name of source dirs for
              your project and these names include symbolic links, then GPS
              will not provide any cross-reference (no matter whether you
              use Fast Project Loading or not)
  Workaround: Use relative dirs if possible in project files

- IB05-015 Gnatcheck plugin issues in remote mode
  Problem:    When using the remote mode, GPS tries to spawn gnatcheck on the
              remote server without using the server's paths for both the
              project file and the optional source files.
  Workaround: Use gnatcheck locally.

- IA21-005 Key Shortcuts editor dialog is now clearer
  Problem:    When you press Grab in the key shortcuts editor, you are left
              with a busy cursor with no obvious indication that GPS is
              waiting for input.
  Workaround: Press the new shortcut you wish to assign.

- IA13-032 Source navigation in C/C++ in long paths
  Problem:    Under Windows, the C/C++ source navigation in GPS might not
              work when the project is located in a long path (around 100
              characters) and/or in a path that contains upper-case
              characters.
  Workaround: Move the project in a shorter path with lower-case characters.

- I612-002 Name Parameters and dotted notation
  Problem:    When a primitive operation is called using the new Ada05
              dotted notation, the refactoring Name Parameter repeats the
              first parameter name (even though it is in fact given
              before the ".").
  Workaround: Change to standard call, do the renaming, and then back to
              the dotted notation.

- GA10-023 Completion problems with UTF-8
  Problem:    On certain cases, the smart complete action may not work on
              identifiers containing complex UTF-8 characters.
  Workaround: Manually fix the code.
