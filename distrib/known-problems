Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.3.0

- GB20-003: VCS not properly detected for subprojects
  Problem:    When using a hierarchy of projects, if a subproject has a VCS set
              but the root project does not have a VCS set, GPS is unable to
              call VCS operations on sources belonging to the subproject.
  Workaround: Set a VCS on the root project.

Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.2.0

- GA24-020: Wrong cursor location after using Smart Completion
  Problem:    When using Smart Completion, when removing characters after
              having performed a first completion, the cursor might jump at the
              beginning of the current entity.
  Workaround: Move the cursor back to the right location.

- GA12-014: C++ cross-references and library project files
  Problem:    If you are using a library project file, GPS will not find the
              cross-reference information generated by the Compute C++ Xref
              Info menu, and as a result no contextual menu for navigation
              will be visible.
  Workaround: Create a link from the object directory to the library directory
              (or copy the files manually after selecting the menu to compute
              the info).
