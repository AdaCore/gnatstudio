Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.2.0

- G328-021 Problem displaying variant record in debugger
  Problem:    GPS was not properly displaying variables of a type with a
              variant record having an enumerated type discriminant eg
                 type Foo (D : Discriminant) is record
                    case D is
                    when Bool =>
                       A_Boolean : Boolean;
                    when Int  =>
                       An_Int    : Integer;
                    when Real =>
                       A_Real    : Float;
                    end case;
                 end record;
              were type Discriminant is declared as
                 type Discriminanant is (Bool, Int, Real);
  Workaround: Let us say you want to display variable Var. What you can do is
              issue the following command in the debugger console:
                 (gdb) graph display `print Var`
              As a result, the output of the command "print Var" will be
              displayed in the debugger data canvas.

- G316-005 Auto-casing is confused by string quotes characters constants.
  Problem:    When a string quote character is used ('"' in Ada or C), and
              a string constant is following this character constant, then GPS
              will apply the casing inside the string.
  Workaround: Deactivate the auto-casing, or use a newline character after
              the string quote character.

- G315-003 Selecting a display option on debug datas has no effect.
  Problem:    When a data is displayed in the debug data window, a contextual
              menu allow to specify how to display it. This menu has no effect.
  Workaround: Type "graph display `p /x the_var`" in the debugger console to
              display the variable 'the_var' in hexadecimal. Use /o for octal,
              /t for binary.

- G306-007 Multiple dialogs appearing on key shortcuts.
  Problem:    Some dialogs, such as the "Continue Search?" dialog or the
              "Open File" dialog, might appear multiple times when launched
              through key shortcuts.
  Workaround: The extraneous dialogs can be closed safely.

- G225-003 Activity indicator show "busy" state when using some plugins
  Problem:    When using some plugins which launch a process in the background,
              such as the spell checking "ispell" plugin, the GPS activity
              indicator in the top-right corner show a busy state while the
              process is running.
  Workaround: Refer to the Task Manager to determine activity status of GPS.

- DB25-010 Symbols not loaded when initializing cross debugger
  Problem:    When using GPS in a remote debugging configuration (ie, with the
              debugger running on a machine other than the executable being
              debugged) other than VxWorks environments, the underlying
              debugger does not load the debug symbols.
  Workaround: Load the symbols manually using the appropriate "file", "target"
              and "load" commands in the debugger console.
