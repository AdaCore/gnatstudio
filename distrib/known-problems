Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.5.0

- J520-004: Launching of external Python-based build or scripts fails
  Problem:    GPS internally sets the PYTHONHOME and PYTHONPATH variables to
              point to its packaged Python libraries. This might be a problem
              when launching python-based build commands or external scripts.
  Workaround: Create a wrapper around the python-based build commands or
              scripts to unset the PYTHONHOME and PYTHONPATH variables.

- J520-002: Sorting source files in project editor
  Problem:    The list of source files in the project editor is not sorted,
              making it harder to locate a file
  Workaround: Once you have selected a file, you can use ctrl-F to search
              for other files in the list

- J507-011: Project View broken when toggling Show Absolute Path
  Problem:    If you toggle (from the contextual menu) the display of
              absolute paths twice (to get back to displaying relative
              paths), the paths are displayed relative to the current
              directory rather than relative to the project the directory
              belongs to. This is when Show Flat View is enabled
  Workaround: Restart GPS after setting your preferred setup

- J422-045: Prefix completion doesn't work with one parameter functions
  Problem:    When completing a function with only one parameter, prefix
              notation does not work properly.
  Workaround: Manually complete the code.

- J422-030: Removed files not properly detected
  Problem:    A file removed outside GPS was not properly detected. Now a
              dialog is raised asking if a new empty file must be created
              or if the current buffer content is to be saved.
  Workaround: Delete the file from within GPS using the Project Explorer's
              contextual menu.

- J409-002: dispatching.py plugin loads too many ALI files
  Problem:    When it recomputes the list of dispatching calls, this plugin
              will in fact reload more .ali files than are really needed,
              thus slowing things down.
  Workaround: It might be faster if you use Build/Load Xref In Memory

- J406-019: Docgen does not see documentation of nested generics
  Problem:    In case of a nested generic package of subprogram, the GPS
              documentation generator won't interprete comments before the
              generic keyword as the construct's documentation.
  Workaround: Place the construct's documentation after the construct's
              definition

- J319-001: Continuing search after changing scenario finds wrong files
  Problem:    If you start a search in "Files From Project", but then change
              the scenario so that the list of source files changes (or their
              location), then pressing Next in the dialog might find matching
              text in a file that is no longer part of the project.
  Workaround: GPS will now automatically reset the current search, so that the
              Next button becomes Find. You can achieve the same result by
              modifying the search pattern after changing the scenario.

- J311-010: Mains not listed if number of projects exceeds 127
  Problem:    If the project tree contains 128 or more projects, the mains
              might not get listed in the Build->Project submenu.
  Workaround: Create custom build targets using the Target Configuration
              dialog (menu Build->Settings).

- J302-006: No completion for nested packages on use clauses
  Problem:    When completing a use clause, nested packages are not offered.
  Workaround: Manually complete the code.

- J212-018: Error when editing a project with indexed attributes assignments
  Problem:    When you are editing a project, GPS first tries to normalize
              it. This normalization fails if your project contains an
              assignment like
                 for Switches use Imported.Compiler'Switches;
              where the Switches attribute excepts an index in general but
              not is provided here.
  Workaround: Either rename directly the whole Compiler package, or specify
              the attribute for Switches, for instance
                 for Switches ("ada") use Imported.Compiler'Switches ("ada");

- J212-001: GPS fails to load icons when launched with relative path on unix
  Problem:    When running gps on unix systems with a relative path, e.g.
              ./gps/bin/gps
              GPS will fail to load some resources (e.g. icons).
  Workaround  Launch GPS with no path, or an absolute path.

- J209-021: GPS is slow when replacing many occurences from an editor
  Problem:    When a lot of occurences have to be replaced through a "replace
              all" from an editor, GPS may take a lot of time to perform the
              operation.
  Workaround: Do the replace operation when the editor is closed.

- IC01-004: Issues with project switching
  Problem:    When switching from a project A to a project B within GPS (for
              instance through the menu Project->Open...), GPS might be unable
              to load completely the new project B if it contains a scenario
              variable that has the same name as a variable in project A, but
              the value of that variable in project A is not a valid value in
              the context of project B.
  Workaround: Instead of switching within GPS, close GPS and re-open it on
              project B.

- IB06-021: No xref when Source_Dirs contains unresolved links
  Problem:    If you have used absolute paths in the name of source dirs for
              your project and these names include symbolic links, then GPS
              will not provide any cross-reference (no matter whether you
              use Fast Project Loading or not)
  Workaround: Use relative dirs if possible in project files

- IB05-015: Gnatcheck plugin issues in remote mode
  Problem:    When using the remote mode, GPS tries to spawn gnatcheck on the
              remote server without using the server's paths for both the
              project file and the optional source files.
  Workaround: Use gnatcheck locally.

- IA21-005: Key Shortcuts editor dialog is now clearer
  Problem:    When you press Grab in the key shortcuts editor, you are left
              with a busy cursor with no obvious indication that GPS is
              waiting for input.
  Workaround: Press the new shortcut you wish to assign.

- IA13-032: Source navigation in C/C++ in long paths
  Problem:    Under Windows, the C/C++ source navigation in GPS might not
              work when the project is located in a long path (around 100
              characters) and/or in a path that contains upper-case
              characters.
  Workaround: Move the project in a shorter path with lower-case characters.

- IA07-021: Unexpected scrolling in debugger data window
  Problem:    If you double-click in a box in the data window to display
              another box, an unexpected scrolling can occur.
  Workaround: If needed, scroll back to the location you want to see.

- I612-002: Name Parameters and dotted notation
  Problem:    When a primitive operation is called using the new Ada05
              dotted notation, the refactoring Name Parameter repeats the
              first parameter name (even though it is in fact given
              before the ".").
  Workaround: Change to standard call, do the renaming, and then back to
              the dotted notation.

- GA10-023: Completion problems with UTF-8
  Problem:    On certain cases, the smart complete action may not work on
              identifiers containing complex UTF-8 characters.
  Workaround: Manually fix the code.
