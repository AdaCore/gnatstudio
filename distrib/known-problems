Known Problems fixed in GPS 6.1.0 / GNATbench 2.9.0

- JC07-006 GPS: rsh leaving remote processes as zombies in remote mode.
  Problem:    When using GPS remote mode with rsh, it may happen that spawned
              remote processes are not properly terminated before the rsh
              connection is closed.
              This may lead to zombie processes remaining on the remote host.
              rsh support by GPS has now been deprecated, as rsh is not an
              active development anymore, and has been replaced by secure and
              more robust solutions such as ssh.
  Workaround: Use ssh instead. If absolutely needed, you can re-enable rsh
              support by using the remote_rsh.py plugin, to be activated from
              the Tools->Plug-ins menu.
