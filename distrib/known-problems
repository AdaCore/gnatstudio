Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.3.0

- GC07-025: Ouline View can't display large profile
  Problem:    Routines with a large profile (more than 50 parameters)
              won't be properly output in the outline view.
  Workaround: Disable the output of the routine profile.

- GB20-003: VCS not properly detected for subprojects
  Problem:    When using a hierarchy of projects, if a subproject has a VCS set
              but the root project does not have a VCS set, GPS is unable to
              call VCS operations on sources belonging to the subproject.
  Workaround: Set a VCS on the root project.
