Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.0.0

- F321-010 Using the file selector on Windows changes the working directory
  Problem:    If opening a file in a different directory than the working
              directory, doing so with the Windows' file selector changes the
              working directory
  Workaround: Select back the working directory using the 'Change Dir' menu
              function.

- F317-003 Auto-saved file not deleted when saving into a new name
  Problem:    If a file creates an auto-saved file and then is saved into an
              other name, the auto-saved file is not removed. As a consequence,
              when the original file is re-opened, GPS tries to retreived
              and auto-saved file.
  Workaround: The auto-saved file has to be manually deleted before the
              re-opening of the original file.

- F308-037 Infinite loop when displying a tooltip
  Problem:    GPS may fall in an infinite loop when displying a tooltip. The
              problem occurs when GPS tries to extract the comments associated
              with an entity whose declaration belongs to the first block of
              code in a file (without any blank line in between) and when this
              block of code is on the second line of a file (the first line
              must be blank).
  Workaround: Disable the tooltips using Preferences/Editor facility.

- F223-020 Changing order of source dirs has no effect
  Problem:    In the project properties editor, if you change the order of
              the source directories through the Up and Down buttons, without
              modifying or adding any directory, the change is not saved in
              the project.
  Workaround: Edit the project file manually (available through the contextual
              menu on a project node in the Project View)

- F223-004 Cannot display complex variant record in debugger
  Problem:    When trying to display under the debugger a complex data mixing
              arrays, enumerations and variant records, GPS will sometimes
              display instead 'Unknown variable'.
  Workaround: Use the tooltip, or 'print variable' instead of 'graph display'

- F221-022 Consoles with spaces in their names
  Problem:    When you create, from python, a new console with a space or
              other XML special characters in its name, GPS will report a
              failure loading one of its internal files (history) on the
              next startup
  Workaround: remove the incorrect line in the $HOME/.gps/history file, and
              do not use spaces in the name for the console

- F220-009 Relative paths in project properties on Windows
  Problem:    On Windows, using the system file selection dialog will change
              the current directory. As a result, if you edit the project
              properties when using relative paths, and if you select, for
              any of the attributes, a file through this dialog, this will
              break the list of source files for this project
  Workaround: Use the GPS dialog to select files (see the preferences), or
              use absolute paths in the project properties editor.

- F216-011 Outline view not refreshed properly
  Problem:    It sometimes happens that the outline view indicates there are
              no entities even though an editor is selected. This generally
              happens either on startup when the welcome dialog is used to
              select a project or when a floating search window has
              just been used
  Workaround: click in another window, and then back in the editor to force
              a refresh

- F209-004 Incorrect display and setting of array indexed by enum in debugger
  Problem:    In the debugger, when displaying graphically the contents of
              an array indexed by an enumeration, GPS will compute bounds
              off by one, causing confusion when e.g. modifying the contents
              of some elements of the array.
  Workaround: Modifying/display the array in the debugger console

- F208-020 Recomputing a visual diff misbehaving
  Problem:    The contextual menu Visual Diff/Recompute is not doing all its
              processing.
  Workaround: Close the visual diff and reopen it either using the VCS module
              or the Tools/Visual Diff menus.

- F131-018 Cannot launch external process when name contains spaces
  Problem:    When using the Process API in GPS shell or Python, it is not
              possible to launch processes using their full paths when this
              path contains spaces.
  Workaround: Put the executable in your PATH and launch it using its base
              name, or move the executable to a PATH that doesn't contain
              spaces.

- F128-007 Project view: No direct response on expand sub item
  Problem:    Expanding a category needs two consecutive clicks.
  Workaround: Click two times on the category to expand it.

- F120-025 Python menu doesn't properly reload scripts
  Problem:    If you have added Python as a supported language in your
              project, GPS creates a python menu every time you edit a
              python file. This menu contains a "Reload" entry, which has no
              effect on the python console in fact.
  Workaround: type manually "import ..." or "reload (...)" in the python
              console

- F119-004 Recovered files are marked as 'unmodified'
  Problem:    When recovering a file from its backup, GPS opens it marked
              'unmodified', and it is not possible to save it directly (you
              have to edit it first).
  Workaround: Just edit the file (adding a character and removing it is enough)

- F118-002 GPS Code fix fails when formal is access procedure
  Problem:    With an access to procedure parameter in the Ada 05 fashion,
              fixing a non conformant subprogram profile would give a wrong
              result.
  Workaround: Do manually the fix

- F106-014 GPS auto-casing does not support unicode characters
  Problem:    GPS was not properly changing the case of identifiers with
              unicode characters (like the Greek letter Pi for example).
  Workaround: Disable the auto-casing in the preferences or press ctrl-q
              before the space as this disable the auto-casing of last word.

- F104-007 GPS split MDI when opening log files
  Problem:    The log files are opened by splitting the MDI when using the
              Edit log file VCS command. When using the command
              Commit (via revision log) the MDI is not split, the file is
              placed with the consoles if possible. For consistency, this is
              now the new behavior for the Edit log file.
  Workaround: Move the log editor manually

- F103-012 Loading new project breaks the desktop
  Problem:    If you load a project through the menu Project->Recent or
              Project->Load, the desktop is improperly updated, and some
              windows have unexpected sizes
  Workaround: Use the -P command line parameter to GPS to specify the
              project directly on the command line.

- EB16-002 Wrong parenthesis highlighting
  Problem:    Parentheses in comments are taken into account when doing the
              highlighting of matching parenthesis.
  Workaround: Use the search dialog to find the next/previous parenthesis
