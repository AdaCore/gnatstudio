Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.4.0

- HA05-007: Cannot create .gps directory for path with non ASCII characters
  Problem:    If the HOME (or GPS_HOME) environment variable contains
              non ASCII characters, GPS fails to create the .gps
              directory.
  Workaround: Use a GPS_HOME which contains only plain ASCII characters

- D502-003: Procedure name too long and overlap with VCS status
  Problem:    On the editor's status bar if a procedure name is
              too long it will overlap with the VCS status.
  Workaround: Use the VCS Explorer which displays the proper status
