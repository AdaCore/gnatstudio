Known Problems fixed in GPS 3.2.0

- F210-013 GPS goes in an infinite loop when displaying a tooltip
  Problem:    When trying to display a tooltip if the line just before the
              entity pointed by the mouse is blank but contains several
              characters (' ', horizontal tabulations, etc.) gps may end up
              stuck in an infinite loop.
  Workaround: Disable the Editor tooltip preference

- F207-018 Wrong translation in generated SVG
  Problem:    In some cases after some items in a graph have been moved
              (resulting in a change in the scrolling adjustments) the SVG
              representation of the graph contains a wrong translation.
              The result is that interesting part of the graph are rendered
              out of the sreen by an SVG plugin.
  Workaround: Edit the generated SVG file and change the sign of the x and/or
              y coordinate of the top level translation. 
              Another alternative is simply to adjust the zooming level and/or
              scroll the rendered SVG in order to center interesting parts
              of the graph on the screen.

- F209-018 Manually added -gnatw? switches are silently removed
  Problem:    In the project properties editor, if you manually add some
              switches that start with -gnatw for the Ada compiler (for
              instance -gnatwY), they might be silently deleted the next
              time the project properties are edited
  Workaround: Edit manually the file ada_support.xml in the GPS installation
              to add the switch you want (this should be done for instance by
              copying the line for "-gnatwv")

- F207-016 Examine Entity missing some values for enumerations
  Problem:    If you click on an enumeration type, and select "Examine Entity"
              in the contextual menu, the enumeration literals defined on the
              same line as the closing parenthesis are ignored
  Workaround: put the closing parenthesis on a line of its own

- F128-008 GPS does not always color lines correctly
  Problem:    After some characters have been added on a line, the line is
              not always correctly re-highlighted. This happens when inserting
              a single line comment mark or a string delimiter for example.
  Workaround: You can ignore this visual glitch

- F106-014 GPS auto-casing does not support unicode characters
  Problem:    GPS was not properly changing the case of identifiers with
              unicode characters (like the Greek letter Pi for example).
  Workaround: Disable the auto-casing in the preferences or press ctrl-q
              before the space as this disable the auto-casing of last word.

- F104-007 GPS split MDI when opening log files
  Problem:    The log files are opened by splitting the MDI when using the
              Edit log file VCS command. When using the command
              Commit (via revision log) the MDI is not split, the file is
              placed with the consoles if possible. For consistency, this is
              now the new behavior for the Edit log file.
  Workaround: Move the log editor manually

- F103-012 Loading new project breaks the desktop
  Problem:    If you load a project through the menu Project->Recent or
              Project->Load, the desktop is improperly updated, and some
              windows have unexpected sizes
  Workaround: Use the -P command line parameter to GPS to specify the
              project directly on the command line.

- EC29-006 Wrong indentation of default generic procedures
  Problem:    The Ada editor does not correctly indent constructs such as
              generic
                 with procedure F is Y;
  Workaround: Fix indentation manually or use the "simple indentation" mode

- EC07-009 Leave focus on selected window in the bookmarks view
  Problem:    When you select an existing bookmark in the bookmarks view, the
              focus remains on the bookmark view instead of going to the
              associated editor.
  Workaround: Select the bookmark and then the editor

- EB28-007 Segmentation fault when closing a debug item
  Problem:    When closing a graphic item in the debug data window, a
              segmentation fault might be raised.
  Workaround: The problem is usually handled transparently by GPS, not
              causing visible issues.

- EB16-002 Wrong parenthesis highlighting
  Problem:    Parenthesis in comment are taken into account when doing the
              highlighting of matching parenthesis.
  Workaround: None
