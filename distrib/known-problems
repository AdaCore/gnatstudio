Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.3.0

- H115-022: Directories without source not hidden
  Problem:    Directories containing no source file are not hidden in the
              Project Explorer even-though the hidden directory pattern
              would match.
  Workaround: Edit the project file to remove the directories you want to
              hide.

- H103-004: Revisions not properly highlighted
  Problem:    When clicking on the revision links on annotated files, the
              corresponding revision is not highlighted if the revision is
              already  present in the Revision View.
  Workaround: Close the Revision View before clicking on the version links.

- GC07-025: Ouline View can't display large profile
  Problem:    Routines with a large profile (more than 50 parameters)
              won't be properly output in the outline view.
  Workaround: Disable the output of the routine profile.

- GB20-003: VCS not properly detected for subprojects
  Problem:    When using a hierarchy of projects, if a subproject has a VCS set
              but the root project does not have a VCS set, GPS is unable to
              call VCS operations on sources belonging to the subproject.
  Workaround: Set a VCS on the root project.

- GA26-033: Start/Continue button restarts the program when in remote mode
  Problem:    When using GPS to debug a program using the "remote" protocol,
              the first push on the Start/Continue button causes the program
              to be restarted, instead of continuing the execution.
  Workaround: Type "cont" in the debugger console instead of pressing the
              Start/Continue button.

- G906-021: Auto fixing doesn't indent correctly "pragma Unreferenced"
  Problem:    When GPS insert a "pragma Unreferenced" to fix an unreferenced
              entity warning, the indentation of the pragma may be incorrect.
  Workaround: Manually fix the indentation.

- G621-018: Auto fixing cannot remove variables containing "is"
  Problem:    When a variable type or initialization contains the string "is",
              and is not referenced, the auto fix proposed by GPS doesn't
              manage to remove it properly.
  Workaround: Remove manually the variable.

- FA23-004: Mischosen "from" as parameter name in the python API
  Problem:    "from" had been chosen as a parameter name of several methods of
              the GPS.EditorBuffer class. As a result, it was not possible to
              use named parameters for this methods as "from" is a python
              keyword. It has been replaced with "frm".
  Workaround: Do not use named parameters for methods that have a formal
              parameter named "from".
