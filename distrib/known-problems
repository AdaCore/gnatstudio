Known Problems fixed in GPS 2.1.0

- D603-010 Can't evaluate nested python commands
  Problem:    When you enter interactively a command in the python console,
              nested blocks (a if inside a while for instance), the command
              is never executed properly and results in an error
  Workaround: write the command in a file, and execute that file instead

- D602-016 Duplicate Build menu entries with extending projects
  Problem:    If you are using extending projects, the Build->Make menu
              will contain apparently duplicate entries.
  Workaround: In fact, these entries will build the same executable, but using
              a different project each time. Click on the first entry that
              matches the executable you want to build

- D415-005 Execution window is read-only after the first execution
  Problem:    If you run an external program using the menu Build->Run,
              after the process exits, the execution window becomes read-only
              and cannot be used to input text in following executions of the
              program.
  Workaround: Close the execution window before executing the second time.
