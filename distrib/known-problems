Known Problems fixed in GPS 3.0.0

- E302-018 GPS hangs when modifying invalid debugger memory contents
  Problem:    During a debugging session, trying to modify the contents
              of the memory in the memory view of an invalid address (e.g. 0x0)
              may hang GPS.
  Workaround: Do not modify the contents of the memory in case of an invalid
              address (the memory view will display only '-' characters).

- E221-023 Double-click before the last character of a word doesn't select it
  Problem:    When double-clicking right before the last character of a word,
              the word is not selected.
  Workaround: Select using click-and-drag, or shift+arrow keys.

- E207-021 Can't load a project depending on predefined projects
  Problem:    If your project depends on project files found in the predefined
              project directory of GNAT (XML/Ada, AWS,...), GPS will not
              properly find these dependency projects
  Workaround: Add the directory containing these projects to your
              ADA_PROJECT_PATH environment variable

- E204-020 Wrong display of system.address variables in the debugger
  Problem:    If you do a Debug->Display... on a variable, the box in the data
              window is too short to show the actual value of the variable
  Workaround: Use Debug->Print... instead

- E204-007 Wrong search results in comments
  Problem:    When searching for a string in comments only, or all but
              comments, GPS will sometimes report incorrect matches, or
              not report valid ones.
  Workaround: Use the 'Whole Text' context instead.

- E204-005 Refresh problems after a Commit in the VCS Explorer under Windows
  Problem:    Under Windows, when working on files where the full path has
              some upper case characters, the VCS Explorer is not properly
              refreshed after doing a Commit operation
  Workaround: Refresh the VCS Explorer using the Query Status operation.

- E106-004 GPS crashes when closing editors of a file that has been modified
  Problem:    When a file is modified outside of GPS, and when closing the
              editor associated to this file, it is possible that the editor
              is closed and the dialog "File has changed on disk" appears. In
              this case, choosing "Reload" causes GPS to crash.
  Workaround: Verify that the editor is still open before clicking on "Reload"

- DC21-008 It is impossible to use non-escaped "%" in GPS shell
  Problem:    When creating GPS shell actions, it is not possible to create
              command lines containing the "%" sign, GPS always attempts to
              expand it.
  Workaround: When you need to use the "%" sign, use a python command or an
              external wrapper.

- DB25-012 Contextual menu's filter in File View
  Problem:    If you create a custom contextual menu through an XML file,
              and add a filter so that it appears only in the Files View, this
              filter will not work (module="Files_View"), since the current
              module is considered the same as for the Project View
  Workaround: none found, the contextual menu will appear both in the Files
              and Project view if you use (module="Explorer")

- DB23-002 Retrieve project attribute with spaces
  Problem:    When retrieving through a call to get_attribute_as_string() an
              attribute that contains spaces, they are all quoted by a
              backslash in the result string.
  Workaround: Use get_attribute_as_list and recreate a string from the
              output, without the backslashes.

- DA17-002 Extra spaces added in GPS shell commands
  Problem:    When chaining multiple commands in an action for instance, the
              result of previous commands always ends with a space. Likewise,
              a command like '("a")' results in two command line arguments,
              '("a"' and ')'.
  Workaround: Write commands in python when possible, or surround parameters
              in triple quotes

- DA08-004 Cannot run GtkAda applications from GPS
  Problem:    When you are spawning applications from GPS, the environment has
              been modified by GPS to include its own library directory. Thus,
              the GtkAda libraries that are seen are the GPS ones, not the one
              you had defined in your environment.
  Workaround: Execute your program through a script that sets the proper PATH
              and LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables

- D930-006, D806-004, CB14-005 problems with the help browser under Windows
  Problem:    Under Windows, the integrated help browser cannot display
              properly the long HTML files after a certain point.
  Workaround: Use an external HTML browser to view thise files.

- D713-012 Improper substitution in XML files
  Problem:    When chaining multiple shell commands in an XML action, the
              second command can refer to the output of the first by using %1.
              However, this is improperly detected by GPS when using
              "%1.suffix" (ie the 1 character immediately followed by other
              chars
  Workaround: Put a blank after "%1 "

- D709-005 Pattern field not initialized when search window exists
  Problem:    When selecting the Navigate/Search for the first time, the
              search window is open and the pattern field is initialized with
              the text currently selected in the editor. This doesn't work
              if the search window was already open
  Workaround: Copy the text first, open the search dialog, and paste
