Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.4.0

- CA08-005 Searching file names in explorer fails for extended projects
  Problem:    If you are looking for a specific file name in the project
              explorer, the files in extended project will not be found by
              GPS.
  Workaround: None known

- CA02-013 Unexpected crashes under Windows.
  Problem:    GPS sometimes crashes unexpectedly under windows. This is most
              likely to happen after compiling files several times.
  Workaround: None knowm

- Cross-reference fail with Ada units overriden in extending projects (C825-005)
  Problem:    If you have a unit overriden in an extending project with a
              different file name, cross-references will fail for all files
              that reference that Unit
  Workaround: If possible, remove overriden units in extended projects. If not
              possible, rename them so as to use the same name as in extending
              projects

- Goto Other File fails for C files
  Problem:    If you are editing a C file and select "Goto file spec/body" in
              the contextual menu, a .ads file is generated, ie an Ada file
  Workaround: This works fine if there is indeed a <file>.h in the project.
              Otherwise, just kill the newly created editor

- C917-001 Search/Replace gives wrong results when blocks are folded.
  Problem:    When blocks are folded in the editor, searching for a string or
              for multiple occurrences of a string gives wrong results.
  Workaround: Unfold all blocks before searching.
              (Note that it is not recommended to use block folding in version
               1.3.0)

- C916-010 Internal error when generating new testsuite
  Problem:    When you use the Edit->Unit Testing menu and attempt to add
              a new testsuite, GPS crashes
  Workaround: None known

- C912-003 Removing dependency for a project other than the root project fails
  Problem:    If you remove a dependency between two projects when none of them
              is the root project, GPS will fail.
  Workaround: Edit the project files manually, and reload the project

- C911-008 Hang when highlighting empty string
  Problem:    In some very specific cases, GPS may hang or badly highlight
              source code when e.g. closing an empty string.
  Workaround: None known

- C822-014 Cross-references fail on Ada files with file-specific naming schemes
  Problem:    If you are using Ada files with an irregular naming scheme (ie
              you don't specificy a general way to compute the name of the
              file, but have to specify the mapping unit<->file for each file),
              then cross-references for specs without bodies and separate units
              fail
  Workaround: None known

- C812-004 Searching doesn't take into account a selection in the File View
  Problem:    When a file is selected in the File View, using the search dialog
              will not look into this file but in open editors.
  Workaround: Use the search mode "Files..." or manually open the file before
              searching.

- C805-014 %pp in custom menus doesn't work from source editors
  Problem:    If your custom menu launches a command with the %pp parameter,
              the latter will not be substitued when launched while a source
              editor has the focus.
  Workaround: Select the file in the project view, and activate the menu while
              the latter has the focus

- C508-001 Focus and dialog issues
  Problem:    If you start editing a file, and then click on the [x] button
              in the title bar, this opens a confirmation dialog. Selecting
              Cancel in the dialog doesn't give the focus back to the editor
  Workaround: Click in the editor to gain the focus back

- C502-014 Code fixing does not work on lines containing TABs.
  Problem:    When there are errors in a line containing tabulations, the
              automatic code fixing does not provide an icon to fix errors.
  Workaround: Fix the errors manually.

- Internal error when looking for the body of Unchecked_Deallocation
  Problem:    If you right click on the work Unchecked_Deallocation in Ada
              mode, and ask for its body, an internal error is reported
  Workaround: Unchecked_Deallocation has no body, no need to look for it

- Messages window not raised when initial project has errors
  Problem:    If you load from the command line a project file that contains
              errors, the Messages window is not raised to make them visible.
  Workaround: Switch to the Messages window manually

- Saving project with languages other than Ada doesn't always generate Makefile
  Problem:    If a project is importing another project that has languages
              other than Ada, no Makefile is generated for the project.
  Workaround: run gpr2make by hand

- A project with no source files couldn't be open in the Project View
  Problem:    If source directories were defined for the project, but no
              source file was found in them, the source directories couldn't
              be accessed through the explorer.
  Workaround: Use the Files View to access the directory
