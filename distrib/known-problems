Known Problems fixed in GPS 6.1.0 / GNATbench 2.9.0

- MC09-035: GPS: Color problems with Open Text Exceed 14 X server
  Problem:    When using GPS through the Open Text Exceed 14 X server, all text
              and some widgets are rendered in white, regardless of the
              original color.
  Workaround: Use another X Server (Cygwin's for example)

- N116-040: GPS: Completion mechanism crashes GPS
  Problem:    When using dynamic completion, in some specific scenario, the
              completion resolver for ada constructs would make GPS crash.
  Workaround: Deactivate dynamic completion/don't use completion in that
              scenario.

- N109-027: GPS: incorrect display of abstract entities in entities browser
  Problem:    When an entity is an abstract record, its display in the
              browser duplicates all its fields, and does not list its
              methods.
  Workaround: If you can edit sqlite database, you can do the following
              command on it (only needed the first time it is created, not
              every time it is updated):
                 sqlite3 root_object_dir/gnatinspect.db
                 > update entity_kinds set has_methods='t' where id='H';

- MC13-038: GPS: MDI child "flicker" while being moved.
  Problem:    When moving MDI childs between notebooks, some visual flickering
              was occuring.
  Workaround: Keep using the drag&drop with the flickering, which is only a
              visual side effect.

- MC16-032: GPS: Source window not scrolling after auto complete.
  Problem:    When auto-completing manually (via Ctrl+Space for example), if
              the cursor location after the completion is outside of the
              screen, then the source editor won't scroll to show the cursor.
  Workaround: Scroll manually.

- MC09-024: GPS: C++ sources navigation not working
  Problem:    When the C++ sources have classes which define the operator !=
              the navigation through the C++ files does not work.
  Workaround: Use the "find or replace" menu to locate the entity or the
              omni-search facility.

- MC11-034: GPS: Block completions not working in all cases
  Problem:    The block completion plug-in was not working with simple begin
              blocks, generic packages, procedures and functions.
  Workaround: Complete the blocks manually.

- MC05-001: GPS: Keyboard not working in editor's contextual menus
  Problem:    When in a contextual menu in the editor, keys would be grabbed by
              the editor rather than by the menu
  Workaround: Use the mouse to navigate the contextual menus

- MC04-015: GPS: doesn't launch after opening non-ASCII named file
  Problem:    When hisotry of recently open files contains names with
              non-ASCII characters GPS sometime fails to start.
  Workaround: Set UTF-8 locale before launching GPS.

- MB26-015: GB: Show complete command line in command line editor
  Problem:    When editing the command line before launching the action
              (ex: SPARK2014 > Prove Subprogram) the command line displayed at
              the bottom is incomplete.
  Workaround: None.

- MB22-035: GPS: cannot launch browswer from GPS
  Problem:    Sometimes environment variables exported by GPS wrapper
              prevent the launch of browser.
  Workaround: Write shell wrapper to launch browser in corrected environment.
              Then specify wrapper as browser command in GPS preferences.

- MB20-048: GB: code assist enable not applied to open editors
  Problem:    Enabling or disabling code assist from the preferences
              is not applied to open editors.
  Workaround: Close and reopen the editor(s).

- MB14-058: GPS: the 'next tag' action does not select the first item
  Problem:    In the Locations view, if the currently selected node is
              a file node, then using the 'next tag' action or the
              menu Navigate->Next Locations message will cause the
              second message node to be highlighted.
  Workaround: Use the 'previous tag' action to visit the first node.

- MB13-062: GPS: the key shortcuts are not display in some Build menus
  Problem:    The key shortcuts are not displayed in some menus that
              are present under the Build toplevel menu.
  Workaround: None.

- MB06-009: GPS: 'add to extending project' hides existing files
  Problem:    If you load an extending project in GPS, there is a new
              contextual menu 'Add to extending project' which can be
              used to conveniently copy files from the extended project
              into the extending one. However, if the extending project
              was created manually and is not using the Source_Files
              attribute, the result is that the files that were visible
              before are no longer visible.
  Workaround: edit the extending project and remove the Source_Files
              attribute.

- MB01-006: GPS: create_missing_dirs not working with trailing separators
  Problem:    The plugin create_missing_dirs.py does not create directories
              that are specified with a trailing directory separator.
  Workaround: Create the directories manually, or remove the directory
              separator at the end of the directory specification.

- MA29-023: GPS: Goto declaration/body with a floating window
  Problem:    When having a spec (ads) file open in a non floating window, and
              the corresponding body open in a floating window, using go-to
              body in the spec does not scroll to the corresponding location in
              the body.  
  Workaround: Use goto declaration/body with non floating windows.

- MA29-025: GPS: Search in a floating window
  Problem:    When having a floating window source editor open, as well as a
              non floating one, focusing on the floating and then using the
              search window to search into it would search in the non floating
              window.
  Workaround: Clicking on the window two times will make the search work
  properly.

- MA24-011: GB: UI freeze importing existing GNAT project
  Problem:    Sometimes when running menu "File => Import... => Ada => Existing
              GNAT Project" and when an imported folder already exists in the
              workspace's file system, the UI stops to respond.
  Workaround: Kill GNATbench process and retry the operation. Before retrying
              the import operation, you may have to delete manually in the
              workspace's file system, the folders you want to import.

- JC07-006: GPS: rsh leaving remote processes as zombies in remote mode.
  Problem:    When using GPS remote mode with rsh, it may happen that spawned
              remote processes are not properly terminated before the rsh
              connection is closed.
              This may lead to zombie processes remaining on the remote host.
              rsh support by GPS has now been deprecated, as rsh is not an
              active development anymore, and has been replaced by secure and
              more robust solutions such as ssh.
  Workaround: Use ssh instead. If absolutely needed, you can re-enable rsh
              support by using the remote_rsh.py plugin, to be activated from
              the Tools->Plug-ins menu.

- G928-018: GPS: "center cursor on screen" scrolls horizontally
  Problem:    Using the "center cursor on screen" action causes unwanted
              horizontal scrolling in editors.
  Workaround: Scroll manually.
