Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.5.0

- IA15-008 Typing text while GPS is loading may write in read-only editors
  Problem:    When typing text during the launch phase of GPS, if GPS is
              opening read-only editors, then some of the text typed might be
              inserted in the editors.
  Workaround: Click on the "read-only" label on the bottom-right of editors
              to undo the edition.

- I612-002 Name Parameters and dotted notation
  Problem:    When a primitive operation is called using the new Ada05
              dotted notation, the refactoring Name Parameter repeats the
              first parameter name (even though it is in fact given
              before the ".").
  Workaround: Change to standard call, do the renaming, and then back to
              the dotted notation.
