Known Problems fixed in GPS 1.0.0

- Tooltip displayed outside the source editor
  Problem:    When an editor has the focus, a tooltip may be displayed, even
              if the mouse is outside the editor area.
  Workaround: Click on another window or move the mouse to make the tooltip
              disappear

- Cursor no longer hidden under Windows
  Problem:    Under Windows, the mouse cursor sometimes disappears (e.g in the
              help window).
  Workaround: Moving the mouse will make it reappear.

- IDE project attributes not taken into account
  Problem:    When setting values for the compiler or debugger, GPS will not
              take them into account when building or debugging.
  Workaround: Use a wrapper script called gnatmake (or gdb) that calls the
              proper tool (e.g powerpc-wrs-vxworks-gnatmake).
