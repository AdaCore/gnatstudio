Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.1.0

- F629-007 Status bar says line 0 when indentation disabled
  Problem:    Let's consider a source editor for which no automatic indentation
              is performed either because it as been explicitely disable in the
              preference dialog or because the corresponding language is
              unknown. Set the cursor at the end of the editor and press
              ENTER. At this point the status bar says the cursor is located
              on line 0 which is obvisously not the case.
  Workaround: Move the cursor a line up and then down again to force the
              refresh of the line information in the status bar. You can also
              type some text.

- F622-014 Key shortcuts and menu mnemonics
  Problem:    When you create a new key shortcut for an action, and when this
              shortcut matches one of the mnemonics used by gtk+ for menus, for
              instance alt-w for the Window menu, then the key shortcut is
              incorrectly displayed in the menus.
  Workaround: Although not visible, the shortcut works as expected

- Cannot create key shortcuts for menus created from python
  Problem:    When a menu is created in python with GPS.Menu.create(), no
              key bindings can be defined for them through the
              /Edit/Key Shortcuts menu or gtk+'s dynamic key binding
  Workaround: Create an action (through "<action>" in XML), then associate a
              menu to it, and possibly a key shortcut as well
