Known Problems fixed in GPS 4.5.0

- J331-011: Files not normalized when opened from debugger view
  Problem:    From the call stack view, if GPS opens a new editor when clicking
              on a frame, then the corresponding file might not contain a
              normalized path, and contextual menus in the editor might not
              contain all expected menus.
  Workaround: Close the editor and open a new one from the project view or
              using shift+F3.

- J319-001: Continuing search after changing scenario finds wrong files
  Problem:    If you start a search in "Files From Project", but then change
              the scenario so that the list of source files changes (or their
              location), then pressing Next in the dialog might find matching
              text in a file that is no longer part of the project.
  Workaround: GPS will now automatically reset the current search, so that the
              Next button becomes Find. You can achieve the same result by
              modifying the search pattern after changing the scenario.

- J311-010: Mains not listed if number of projects exceeds 127
  Problem:    If the project tree contains 128 or more projects, the mains
              might not get listed in the Build->Project submenu.
  Workaround: Create custom build targets using the Target Configuration
              dialog (menu Build->Settings).

- J302-006: No completion for nested packages on use clauses
  Problem:    When completing a use clause, nested packages are not offered.
  Workaround: Manually complete the code.

- J212-018 Error when editing a project with indexed attributes assignments
  Problem:    When you are editing a project, GPS first tries to normalize
              it. This normalization fails if your project contains an
              assignment like
                 for Switches use Imported.Compiler'Switches;
              where the Switches attribute excepts an index in general but
              not is provided here.
  Workaround: Either rename directly the whole Compiler package, or specify
              the attribute for Switches, for instance
                 for Switches ("ada") use Imported.Compiler'Switches ("ada");

- J212-001 GPS fails to load icons when launched with relative path on unix
  Problem:    When running gps on unix systems with a relative path, e.g.
              ./gps/bin/gps
              GPS will fail to load some resources (e.g. icons).
  Workaround  Launch GPS with no path, or an absolute path.

- J209-021 GPS is slow when replacing many occurences from an editor
  Problem:    When a lot of occurences have to be replaced through a "replace
              all" from an editor, GPS may take a lot of time to perform the
              operation.
  Workaround: Do the replace operation when the editor is closed.

- IC01-004 Issues with project switching
  Problem:    When switching from a project A to a project B within GPS (for
              instance through the menu Project->Open...), GPS might be unable
              to load completely the new project B if it contains a scenario
              variable that has the same name as a variable in project A, but
              the value of that variable in project A is not a valid value in
              the context of project B.
  Workaround: Instead of switching within GPS, close GPS and re-open it on
              project B.

- IB06-021 No xref when Source_Dirs contains unresolved links
  Problem:    If you have used absolute paths in the name of source dirs for
              your project and these names include symbolic links, then GPS
              will not provide any cross-reference (no matter whether you
              use Fast Project Loading or not)
  Workaround: Use relative dirs if possible in project files

- IB05-015 Gnatcheck plugin issues in remote mode
  Problem:    When using the remote mode, GPS tries to spawn gnatcheck on the
              remote server without using the server's paths for both the
              project file and the optional source files.
  Workaround: Use gnatcheck locally.

- IA21-005 Key Shortcuts editor dialog is now clearer
  Problem:    When you press Grab in the key shortcuts editor, you are left
              with a busy cursor with no obvious indication that GPS is
              waiting for input.
  Workaround: Press the new shortcut you wish to assign.

- IA13-032 Source navigation in C/C++ in long paths
  Problem:    Under Windows, the C/C++ source navigation in GPS might not
              work when the project is located in a long path (around 100
              characters) and/or in a path that contains upper-case
              characters.
  Workaround: Move the project in a shorter path with lower-case characters.

- IA07-021 Unexpected scrolling in debugger data window
  Problem:    If you double-click in a box in the data window to display
              another box, an unexpected scrolling can occur.
  Workaround: If needed, scroll back to the location you want to see.

- I612-002 Name Parameters and dotted notation
  Problem:    When a primitive operation is called using the new Ada05
              dotted notation, the refactoring Name Parameter repeats the
              first parameter name (even though it is in fact given
              before the ".").
  Workaround: Change to standard call, do the renaming, and then back to
              the dotted notation.

- GA10-023 Completion problems with UTF-8
  Problem:    On certain cases, the smart complete action may not work on
              identifiers containing complex UTF-8 characters.
  Workaround: Manually fix the code.
