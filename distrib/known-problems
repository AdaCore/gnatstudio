Known Problems fixed in GPS 3.1.0

- E521-009 Search does not work in untitled window
  Problem:    Performing a "Current File" search does not work when the current 
              file is a new file not yet saved on disk. The action is actually
              performed on the last opened editor whose file exists on disk
              (if any).

- E525-008 Endless query for password when using remote files
  Problem:    If you enter an incorrect user name or press cancel in the dialog
              when accessing a remote file, GPS will keep asking for your
              password, preventing you from doing anything else
  Workaround: Kill GPS

- E308-016 Cannot initialize debugger under Tru64
  Problem:    In some cases, when initializing the debugger under Tru64,
              an error message is displayed in the debugger console such as:
              /dev/ptyrd: No such file or directory.
              /proc/380269: No such file or directory.
  Workaround: Disable the "Execution Window" preference in the Debugger section
