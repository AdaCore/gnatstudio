This is the README file for the binary distribution of GPS.
This directory contains the files needed for installing and running GPS.

INSTALLING

To install GPS, run the 'doinstall' script contained in this directory and
then follow the instructions. Make sure that you have sufficient priviledges
to install GPS under the directory chosen: the default directory proposed
requires usually administrator rights (e.g. sudo doinstall).

USING

GPS comes with a user's guide and a tutorial available in HTML format using
the help menu under GPS itself, or by following the links from the welcome
page displayed when launching GPS, or directly in the directory
$base/share/doc/gps/html, where $base is the base directory chosen when
installing GPS (using doinstall).

Optionally, you might want to setup the environment variable GPS_DOC_PATH
to point to new doc directories. See the GPS documentation for more details.

RUNNING GPS UNDER MAC OS X

Under Mac OS X, GPS requires a running X11 server. X11 is distributed as part
of Mac OS X. 

Once you have X11 running, if you are launching GPS from a regular Terminal,
you first need to call
  export DISPLAY=:0

RUNNING GPS ON LINUX X86_64

The GPS binary is a 32 bit application and needs two 32 bit libraries
installed if not already present on the 64 bit system. These two libraries
are libjpeg and libpng.

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux (release 4 for 64-bit AMD64/Intel EM64T),
the packages can be found as:
  libjpeg-6b-*.i386.rpm
  libpng-1.2.*.i386.rpm

For SuSE Linux Enterprise Server (version 9 service pack 1), the packages
can be found as:
  libjpeg-32bit-9-200407011229.x86_64.rpm (on Release CD #1)
  libpng-32bit-9-200408140621.x86_64.rpm (on SP 1 CD #1)
