This is the README file for the binary distribution of GPS.
This directory contains the files needed for installing and running GPS.

INSTALLING

To install GPS, run the 'doinstall' script contained in this directory and
then follow the instructions.

USING

GPS comes with a user's guide and a tutorial available in HTML format using
the help menu under GPS itself, or by following the links from the welcome
page displayed when launching GPS, or directly in the directory
$base/doc/gps/html, where $base is the base directory chosen when installing
GPS (using doinstall).

Optionally, you might want to setup the environment variable GPS_DOC_PATH
to point to new doc directories. See the GPS documentation for more details.

UNNING GPS ON MAC OS X

The current version of GPS on Mac OS X requires an X11 server. Such a server
is distributed with Mac OS X Panther and Mac OS X Tiger.

Additionally, if you are launching GPS from a standard Terminal, you need to
specify the display on which to launch GPS, by doing
   export DISPLAY=:0
