This is the README file for the binary distribution of GPS.
This directory contains the files needed for installing and running GPS.

INSTALLING

The quick way to install GPS is to run the script 'doinstall' contained
in this directory and then follow the instructions.

USE

GPS comes with a user's guide and a tutorial available in HTML format using
the help menu under GPS itself, or by following the links from the welcome
page displayed when launching GPS, or directly in the directory
$base/doc/gps/html, where $base is the base directory chosen when installing
GPS (using doinstall).

The GPS user's guide is a work in progress at this stage; the tutorial is
pretty complete, so it is recommended to get familiar with most of the
functionalities.
