This is the README file for the binary distribution of GNAT Studio.
This directory contains the files needed for installing and running
GNAT Studio.

INSTALLING

To install GNAT Studio, run the 'doinstall' script contained in this directory
and then follow the instructions. Make sure that you have sufficient privileges
to install GNAT Studio under the directory chosen: the default directory
proposed requires usually administrator rights (e.g. sudo doinstall).

You can also install this package in non-interactive mode by specifying
the installation directory as the parameter to doinstall:

  ./doinstall /path/to/gnatstudio/install

USING

GNAT Studio comes with a user's guide and a tutorial available in HTML format
using the help menu under GNAT Studio itself, or by following the links from
the welcome page displayed, or directly in the directory
$base/share/doc/gnatstudio/html, where $base is the base directory chosen when
installing GNAT Studio (using doinstall).

Optionally, you might want to setup the environment variable
GNATSTUDIO_DOC_PATH to point to new doc directories. See the GNAT Studio
documentation for more details.
