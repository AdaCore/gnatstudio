NF-18-PA12-040 GPS: remove entity information in Project view (2016-10-13)

  We no longer display the list of entities defined in a file, in the
  Project view. This information is already available in the Outline,
  whenever a file is selected in the Project view. Removing it allowed us
  to speed up the display of the tree view.
