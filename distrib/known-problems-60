Known problems fixed in GPS 6.1 / GNATbench 2.9
-----------------------------------------------

KP-60-N602-060 GPS: saving file via symlink might no longer find it in project

  Problem:    When source files are found via symbolic links (a.adb points to
              a file with a different name elsewhere), and the file is saved,
              it might no longer be recognized as part of the project (because
              GPS is now internally using the fully resolved path).

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-06-03

  Workaround: Select the menu /Project/Reload.

KP-60-N523-013 GPS: no error reported when root object_dir is read-only

  Problem:    When the root project has a read-only object directory, GPS
              will not be able to create the xref database. No error is
              reported to the user, and GPS actually spends time loading the
              xref info for the files over and over.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-05-28

  Workaround: Make the root object directory writable, or use the
              Ide'Xref_Database attribute to move the database somewhere else.

KP-60-N521-002 GPS: crash or freeze after compiling

  Problem:    After a compilation, GPS might freeze or crash as it is
              attempting to provide auto-fixes for error messages, if
              the error messages are in a location that does not exist.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-05-23

  Workaround: Build outside of GPS to fix these errors.

KP-60-N516-014 GPS: error when toggling sort order

  Problem:    Changing the sort order in the outline view (alphabetical to
              code order, or the opposite) triggers an internal error in GPS,
              which results in various error messages or even crashes GPS.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-05-19

  Workaround: after toggling the sort order, exit GPS and restart.

KP-60-N505-025 project's gnatlist attribute sometimes ignored

  Problem:    The "gnatls" command listed in the project (which in particular
              is used to point to alternative runtimes via the --RTS switch)
              is not properly taken into account on the initial loading of
              the project.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1.0 on 2014-05-13

  Workaround: Reloading the project fixes the issue, but does not apply to
              the gnatinspect tool which GPS uses for the cross-references,
              so the latter will still point to the wrong runtime files.

KP-60-N425-013 GB: no current word highlighting control

  Problem:    The current word under the cursor is highlighted even
              after deactivating Toggle Mark Occurrences control in the
              toolbar. This happens for Eclipse Kepler (version 4.3).
              Also word matching is imprecise. For example, when the
              cursor is over the reserved word "is", other words containing
              the substring (e.g. "this", "distributed") are also highlighted.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9 on 2014-04-29

  Workaround: No workaround needed.

KP-60-N424-023 GPS: freeze or crash when folding blocks

  Problem:    When folding or unfolding block, GPS might freeze or crash.
              This is particularly likely to occur on big files when
              using a custom highlighter implemented with the highlighter.py
              plug-in.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1.0 on 2014-05-01

  Workaround: Wait for the highlighting operation to have completed before
              folding/unfolding blocks.

KP-60-N423-020 GPS: typed text inserted in wrong window

  Problem:    In search dialog, after hit TAB key, combobox button is focused.
              This causes typed text to be inserted in text editor instead of
              replace entry, as expected.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-05-27

  Workaround: Hit TAB key twice to focus replace entry.

KP-60-N423-019 GPS: dropping files does not work on a read-only editor

  Problem:    When drag-and-dropping a file from the window manager on top
              of a source editor, the file does not open in GPS if the source
              editor was read-only.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-04-23

  Workaround: Open the file via the Open File dialog.

KP-60-N423-018 GPS: Undo/Redo not functioning

  Problem:    In some circumstances, right after closing a source editor, the
              undo/redo commands do not work on the current editor.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-04-23

  Workaround: Click in another area of GPS, and click back in the current
              source editor.

KP-60-N418-029 GPS: Size of line numbers area not following font size

  Problem:    When changing the size of the default editor font
              (for instance via the menu Edit/Text size), the size allocated
              to line numbers is not resized, which can result in truncated
              line numbers.

  Status:     Fixed in 6.1 on 2014-04-18

  Workaround: Restart GPS.

KP-60-N410-050 GPS: search window dies closing floating window

  Problem:    When opening the search window when a floating source editor is
              opened and focused, and then closing the source editor, the
              search window would be closed as well, and any attempt to open it
              again would crash GPS.

  Status:     Fixed in 6.1 on 2014-05-13.

  Workaround: Open the search window when the main window is focused.

KP-60-N407-001 GPS: GPS crashes on some completions involving generic packages

  Problem:    On completing some generic packages with child packages, the
              constructs engine would go into an infinite recursion loop and
              make GPS crash on Windows.

  Status:     Fixed in 6.1 on 2014-04-11.

  Workaround: Deactivate dynamic smart completion/Don't trigger it on generic
              packages with child packages.

KP-60-N320-050 GPS: cannot deactivate align.py and tab.py plugins

  Problem:    The plug-ins dialog does not allow deactivating align.py
              and tab.py plugins.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.0 on 2014-03-21.

  Workaround: Delete these files from the GPS installation manually.

KP-60-N313-003 GPS: display unchecked unions in debugger

  Problem:    Graphical representation of Ada unchecked unions is broken
              in GPS debug Data Window.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-03-25

  Workaround: Use textual view through 'Print ...' contextual menu or 'print'
              command in gdb console instead of graph display.

KP-60-N312-023 GPS: Windows not remaining docked when using Aero "Snap"

  Problem:    when the Messages windows is floating and then docked using the
              Windows 7/8 "Snap" feature, initiating a compilation causes it
              to go back to its original position and size. The same problem
              occurs with the GPS main window, when clicking on an entry in
              the Locations view.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-04-16

  Workaround: Do not use the "Snap" feature, but position the windows to the
              same position and size manually.

KP-60-N305-008 GPS: characters can be inserted in read-only editors

  Problem:    It is possible to insert characters in some regions of
              the read-only editors.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-03-07

  Workaround: Close and reopen the editor.

KP-60-N304-024 GPS: Search in GPS does not find next character

  Problem:    Sometimes search in GPS editor gets stuck on non-Latin1
              characters.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-03-11

  Workaround: Shift cursor manually when search stucks.

KP-60-N224-035 GPS: xref wrong on windows when file opened with /File/Open

  Problem:    We have noticed from time to time that the xref queries could
              fail on Windows, in particular when the file is opened via the
              menu, because the casing of the file's full path is different
              in this case, and the xref engine did not properly test in a
              case insensitive manner.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-03-10

  Workaround: use the omni-search (shift-F3) to open files.

KP-60-N224-023 GPS: case conversion inserts extra text

  Problem:    GPS inserts text whose case has been converted at the incorrect
              position when the selection starts after last character of the
              line.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-02-27

  Workaround: Start the selection on the first character of the next line.

KP-60-N224-020 GPS: display errors in the console when database is corrupted

  Problem:    When the sqlite database used for cross-reference information
              is corrupted (which so far we have only seen when it is stored
              on a NFS drive) GPS will now display a proper error message in
              the console.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-03-05

  Workaround: When the xref queries start failing, you could try to delete
              the file gnatinspect.db in your project's object_dir, and
              restart GPS.

KP-60-N220-040 GPS: "Close all other editors" does nothing

  Problem:    The "Close all other editors" menu does not work when activated
              from contextual menu of source editor's tabs.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-02-24

  Workaround: Use the global menu "/File/Close All Editors except Current".

KP-60-N217-046 GPS: GPS asks for save confirmation with autognatpp plug-in

  Problem:    When activating the autognatpp plug-in, which is supposed to
              automatically pretty print your file everytime you save it, GPS
              would ask for confirmation.

  Status:     Fixed in 6.1 on 2014-03-24

  Workaround: Don't use the plug-in, or deal with the dialog every time.

KP-60-N217-012 GPS: display errors in text consoles after scrolling

  Problem:    After scrolling in the consoles (such as the Messages window or
              the Debugger console, for instance), the display might be
              garbled.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-04-16

  Workaround: Manually trigger a refresh, for instance by resizing the window.

KP-60-N215-001 GPS: error when process lasts more than 24 hours

  Problem:    GPS displays the elapsed time for external processes. This
              fails when the process has run for more than 24 hours.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-02-17

  Workaround: This only impacts the display; the process itself has correctly
              finished executing.

KP-60-N214-038 GPS: background color for ispell.py not loaded properly

  Problem:    When you change the highlight color used by the ispell plug-in
              via the preferences dialog, the new color is not properly loaded
              the next time GPS is started.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-02-17

  Workaround: Setting the preference works for the current session of GPS. You
              can also write a small python plug-in that contains the
              following code:
                  import GPS
                  GPS.Preference("Plugins/ispell/bgcolor").set("your_color")

KP-60-N213-046 GPS: lockup on code block folding

  Problem:    GPS can lock up when folding code blocks when a user defined code
              highlight color is used.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-02-27

  Workaround: Disable user defined code highlight colors.

KP-60-N211-041 GPS: Debugger stalls when passing '\' as last argument

  Problem:    When running a program under the debugger with an argument
              line ending with the character '\', the debugger will
              not give the prompt back.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-02-18

  Workaround: Use quotes around the argument line.

KP-60-N211-025 GPS: Issue with highlighters

  Problem:    In any python code using highlighter.OverlayStyle with
              use_messages = True, an exception would be raised and the code
              wouldn't work properly. This would cause an issue with the
              auto_highlight_occurences plugin when configured to use the
              speedbar.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-02-12

  Workaround: Use auto_highlight_occurences without the "show in speedbar"
              option activated.

KP-60-N210-037 GB: Eclipse/Workbench load hangs during 90 seconds

  Problem:    When starting GNATbench, the plugin loading progress stops for
              90 seconds. The error log contains multiple timeout errors
              while loading class.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9 on 2014-02-10

  Workaround: Close all Ada projects, restart GNATbench, and open
              needed projects.

KP-60-N207-040 GB: Eclipse UI freeze just after starting to use GNATbench.

  Problem:    When the Eclipse help subsystem is accessed before the
              GNATbench UI plugin initialization was started, the UI may
              randomly freeze.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9 on 2014-02-10

  Workaround: Kill and restart GNATbench

KP-60-N205-040 Wrong indentation of separate protected

  Problem:    The indentation of "protected xxx is separate" constructs is not
              handled properly, causing an exra indentation level.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-02-06

  Workaround: Do not declare the protected object as separate.

KP-60-N205-018 GPS: get_executable_name is case sensitive

  Problem:    The python function get_executable_name does not work on Windows
              when a file has an upper-case name (because the name is
              lower-cased internally by GPS, so it does not find the
              Main'Executable attribute for it in the project file).

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-02-06

  Workaround: Rename the file into all lower-case.

KP-60-N131-031 GPS: Some debugger menus missing when starting gps with --debug

  Problem:    When starting GPS directly on an executable file with the --debug
              option, GPS would be unable to create and query the XRef
              database, which would cause some debugger menus to disappear.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 and 6.0.2 on 2014-04-15

  Workaround: Debug the executable by launching GPS on the project file
              directly, and start the debugging session from GPS.

KP-60-N131-001 GPS crashes on completion

  Problem:    When creating a new default project in an empty directory,
              creating an empty main.adb file, and typing "procedure Main is",
              dynamic completion would crash GPS with a segfault.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-02-07

  Workaround: Deactivate dynamic completion.

KP-60-N129-024 GPS: memory leak when folding/unfolding code blocks

  Problem:    Folding/unfolding code blocks result in significant memory leaks.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-02-10

  Workaround: Avoid use of folding/unfolding code block actions or restart GPS
              periodically.

KP-60-N129-021 WB: "Toggle Breakpoint" not working in Workbench-3.3.5

  Problem:    Double clicking in the Ada Editor ruler does nothing. The
              "Toggle Breakpoint" contextual menu only displays "The chosen
              operation is not currently available" information message.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9 on 2014-02-11

  Workaround: Use the "Breakpoints > Add Breakpoint..." contextual menu or,
              in the Debug perspective, use the "Run > Toggle Breakpoint
              Ctrl+Shift+B)" menu.

KP-60-N116-040 GPS: Completion mechanism crashes GPS

  Problem:    When using dynamic completion in some specific scenarios, the
              completion resolver for ada constructs would make GPS crash.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-01-17

  Workaround: Deactivate dynamic completion or don't use completion in those
              scenarios.

KP-60-N109-027 GPS: incorrect display of abstract entities in entities browser

  Problem:    When an entity is an abstract record, its display in the
              browser duplicates all its fields and does not list its
              methods.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-01-30

  Workaround: If you can edit the sqlite database, execute the following
              command on it (only needed the first time it is created, not
              every time it is updated):
                 sqlite3 root_object_dir/gnatinspect.db
                 > update entity_kinds set has_methods="t" where id="H";

KP-60-MC16-032 GPS: Source window not scrolling after auto complete

  Problem:    When auto-completing manually (via Ctrl+Space, for example), if
              the cursor location after the completion is outside of the
              screen, the source editor won't scroll to show the cursor.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-01-17

  Workaround: Scroll manually.

KP-60-MC13-038 GPS: MDI child "flicker" while being moved

  Problem:    When moving MDI children between notebooks, some visual
              flickering was occuring.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-01-07

  Workaround: Ignore the flickering, which is only a visual side effect.

KP-60-MC12-058 GPS: Inconsistent behavior of Previous/Next Location buttons

  Problem:    Navigation from Location View, Outline View and some others
              are not saved in the navigation history.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-02-04

  Workaround: Use bookmarks instead of navigation history.

KP-60-MC11-034 GPS: Block completions not working in all cases

  Problem:    The block completion plug-in was not working with simple begin
              blocks, generic packages, procedures and functions.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-01-12

  Workaround: Complete the blocks manually.

KP-60-MC09-035 GPS: Color problems with Open Text Exceed 14 X server

  Problem:    When using GPS through the Open Text Exceed 14 X server, all text
              and some widgets are rendered in white, regardless of the
              original color.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-01-30

  Workaround: Use another X Server (Cygwin's for example).

KP-60-MC05-046 GB: Highlight space in GB editor

  Problem:    When text is highlighted and the space bar is pressed, the
              GB Ada editor doesn't replace the highlighted text with space,
              instead, it inserts the space in front of the highlighted text.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9 on 2014-02-10

  Workaround: No workaround needed.

KP-60-MC05-001 GPS: Keyboard not working in editor's contextual menus

  Problem:    When in a contextual menu in the editor, keys are grabbed by
              the editor instead of the menu.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2013-12-09

  Workaround: Use the mouse to navigate the contextual menus.

KP-60-MC04-015 GPS: doesn't launch after opening non-ASCII named file

  Problem:    When the history of recently open files contains names with
              non-ASCII characters, GPS sometime fails to start.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2013-12-05

  Workaround: Set the locale to UTF-8 before launching GPS.

KP-60-MB26-015 GB: Show complete command line in command line editor

  Problem:    When editing the command line before launching the action
              (ex: SPARK2014 > Prove Subprogram), the command line displayed at
              the bottom is incomplete.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9 on 2013-11-27

  Workaround: You can ignore this visual glitch.

KP-60-MB22-035 GPS: cannot launch browswer from GPS

  Problem:    Sometimes environment variables exported by GPS wrapper
              prevent the launch of a browser.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-01-30

  Workaround: Write a shell wrapper to launch the browser in a corrected
              environment. Then specify the wrapper as the browser command
              in GPS preferences.

KP-60-MB20-048 GB: code assist enable not applied to open editors

  Problem:    Enabling or disabling code assist from the preferences
              does not apply it to open editors.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9 on 2013-11-25

  Workaround: Close and reopen the editor(s).

KP-60-MB15-050 GPS: Color Theme preference always says "Custom"

  Problem:    If the color scheme is changed in GPS preferences, the combobox
              displays the "Custom" value.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-02-04

  Workaround: Ignore the displayed value.

KP-60-MB14-058 GPS: the "next tag" action does not select the first item

  Problem:    In the Locations view, if the currently selected node is
              a file node, using the "next tag" action or the "Navigate->Next
              Locations" menu, the second message node is highlighted.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2013-11-14

  Workaround: Use the "previous tag" action to visit the first node.

KP-60-MB13-062 GPS: key shortcuts not displayed in some Build menus

  Problem:    Key shortcuts are not displayed in some menus that
              are present under the Build toplevel menu.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2013-11-13

  Workaround: Use the key shortcut editor to see the corresponding shortcuts.

KP-60-MB07-017 GPS: completion enabled in string literals

  Problem:    When dynamic completion is enabled GPS erroneously computes
              completions for the text written in string literals.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-05-09

  Workaround: Lower the smart completion capability to normal mode.

KP-60-MB06-028 GPS: drag and drop of files opens extraneous editors

  Problem:    When dragging/dropping files from the window manager to GPS
              editors, drops subsequent to the first successful one will
              cause the previous file to be opened as well.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-04-18

  Workaround: Manually close the extra editor.

KP-60-MB06-009 GPS: "add to extending project" hides existing files

  Problem:    If you load an extending project in GPS, there is a new
              contextual menu "Add to extending project" which can be
              used to conveniently copy files from the extended project
              into the extending one. However, if the extending project
              was created manually and is not using the Source_Files
              attribute, the files that were visible are no longer visible.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2013-11-18

  Workaround: Edit the extending project and remove the Source_Files
              attribute.

KP-60-MB01-006 GPS: create_missing_dirs not working with trailing separators

  Problem:    The plugin create_missing_dirs.py does not create directories
              that are specified with a trailing directory separator.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2013-11-01

  Workaround: Create the directories manually or remove the directory
              separator at the end of the directory specification.

KP-60-MA29-025 GPS: Search in a floating window

  Problem:    When a floating window source editor is open as well as a
              non floating one, focusing on the floating window and using the
              search window to search into it would search in the non floating
              window.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2013-11-05

  Workaround: Clicking on the window two times will make the search work
              properly.

KP-60-MA29-023 GPS: Goto declaration/body with a floating window

  Problem:    When a spec (ads) file is open in a non floating window and
              the corresponding body is open in a floating window, using
              "go-to body" in the spec does not scroll to the corresponding
              location in the body.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2013-11-04

  Workaround: Use "goto declaration/body" with non floating windows.

KP-60-M918-001 Wrong indentation of complex entry

  Problem:    When indenting entries with parametrized conditions such as
                entry Received when Arrived (From) is
              the indentation gets confused for the rest of the file.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-02-06

  Workaround: Fix the indentation manually or avoid this construct.

KP-60-M724-025 GPS: no breakpoint marks on relocated project

  Problem:    Breakpoint marks is not displayed when project was compiled and
              moved to another path.

  Status:     Fixed in 6.1 on 2013-09-11.

  Workaround: Use breakpoint view to view list of breakpoints.

KP-60-JC07-006 GPS: rsh leaving remote processes as zombies in remote mode.

  Problem:    When using GPS remote mode with rsh, spawned remote processes
              may not be properly terminated before the rsh connection is
              closed. This may lead to zombie processes remaining on the
              remote host.  Note that rsh support by GPS has now been
              deprecated, as rsh is not in active development anymore and has
              been replaced by secure and more robust solutions such as ssh.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2013-10-31

  Workaround: Use ssh instead. If absolutely needed, you can re-enable rsh
              support by using the remote_rsh.py plugin, to be activated from
              the Tools->Plug-ins menu.

KP-60-G928-018 GPS: "center cursor on screen" scrolls horizontally

  Problem:    Using the "center cursor on screen" action causes unwanted
              horizontal scrolling in editors.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-11-05

  Workaround: Scroll manually.

KP-60-N514-048 GPS: crash when using tab completion in omni-search

  Problem:    When one of the source directories does not exist on the disk,
              using tab completion in the omni-search crashes GPS

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-05-15
              This was fixed in 6.0.2 on 2014-05-15

  Workaround: Check the Messages window for errors about missing source
              directories.

KP-60-N507-006 incorrect normalizing of file names with multiple ".."

  Problem:    When a file name includes something ike "../../" it is not
              always properly normalized. This might result in obscure errors,
              for instance failing to open the file (because the normalized
              name is incorrect) via the cross-references.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-05-13
              This was fixed in 6.0.2 on 2014-05-14

  Workaround: Disable the preference Project/Fast Project Loading

KP-60-N325-035 ECL: event breakpoint on specific exception cannot be created.

  Problem:    Cannot create with the UI Ada Event Breakpoint on specific
              exception raised condition.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9 on 2014-03-27
              This was fixed in 2.8.2 on 2014-05-12

  Workaround: Create and export an "Ada assertion failed" ada event breakpoint.
              Change the following attributes in the "bkpt" exported file.
              - message
                 Event Breakpoint: org.eclipse.cdt.debug.gdb.exception.specific
              - org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.eventbreakpoint_event_id
                 org.eclipse.cdt.debug.gdb.exception.specific
              - org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.eventbreakpoint_event_arg
                 the exception name for the breakpoint ex: constraint_error
              Import the modified "bkpt" file.

KP-60-N305-041 GPS: overwriting symbolic links

  Problem:    When the preference "fast project loading" is enabled, symbolic
              links are never resolved. As a result, saving a file that is
              referenced through a symbolic link replaces the link with
              a regular file, but does not modify the linked file.
              This breaks support for IBM Synergy.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-03-06
              This was fixed in 6.0.2 on 2014-04-01

  Workaround: From Synergy, use 'sync with work area" before checking in
              changes.

KP-60-N227-046 GPS: error when omni-search matches long file names

  Problem:    When using the omni-search in fuzzy-match mode, and the
              characters you type are widely spaced apart (on long file paths
              for instance), GPS might get an internal error and not display
              any result.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-03-03
              This was fixed in 6.0.2 on 2014-03-21

  Workaround: Typing fewer characters will often display a list again, and you
              can select directly in the list.

KP-60-N226-028 GPS: crash when omni-search preview displays a binary file

  Problem:    When using the omni-search and it matches binary files (e.g.,
              either object files, executables, or images) the preview is
              slow and might even crash GPS in some cases.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-03-06
              This was fixed in 6.0.2 on 2014-03-12

  Workaround: Edit the settings for the omni-search and disable the preview.
              An alternative is to make sure the object files and executables
              do not go in the project's source directories.

KP-60-N225-041 GPS: wrong color of documentation window in smart completion

  Problem:    When using smart completion, with the default or Adwaita
              themes, the background of the documentation window is black,
              making contents hard to read.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-02-25
              This was fixed in 6.0.2 on 2014-03-07

  Workaround: Switch to another theme, or edit the CSS file to change the
              foreground color.

KP-60-N224-019 GPS: error creating call graph recursively

  Problem:    The contextual menu "Browsers/[Method Name] calls (recursively)"
              does not work.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-03-06
              This was fixed in 6.0.2 on 2014-05-20

  Workaround: Use the "Browsers/[Method Name] calls" menu instead.

KP-60-N218-041 GPS: cannot install from directory with spaces under unix

  Problem:    When running the doinstall installer under unix systems, the
              installation fails if doinstall is in a pathname
              containing spaces.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-02-20
              This was fixed in 6.0.2 on 2014-02-20

  Workaround: Extract the gps archive into a directory with no spaces.

KP-60-N127-011 GPS: Builder switch "--RTS=.../path/to/runtime_dir"

  Problem:    When in the main project and the Builder switches include --RTS=
              with a relative path, GPS fails to successfully load the
              project.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-01-28
              This was fixed in 6.0.2 on 2014-05-01

  Workaround: Avoid these Builder switches.

KP-60-N116-013 GPS: custom VCS action "diff_working" is not supported

  Problem:    It is not possible to extend an existing VCS to use the
              "diff_working" action defined in the documentation.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-01-16
              This was fixed in 6.0.2 on 2014-01-16

  Workaround: Use one of the other "diff" actions available.

KP-60-MB29-031 GPS: rsync failures in remote mode

  Problem:    When syncing remote and local directories using rsync and a
              password is requested, the rsync fails and GPS is not
              asking the use for a password.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-02-11
              This was fixed in 6.0.2 on 2014-03-20

  Workaround: Use a passwordless connection via an ssh agent, for example, or
              use network directories.

KP-60-MA24-011 GB: UI freeze importing existing GNAT project

  Problem:    When running menu "File => Import... => Ada => Existing GNAT
              Project" and an imported folder already exists in the
              workspace's file system, the UI sometimes stops responding.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9 on 2014-01-14
              This was fixed in 2.8.2 on 2014-05-12

  Workaround: Kill the GNATbench process and retry the operation. Before
              retrying the import operation, you may have to manually delete
              the folders you want to import.

KP-60-M829-007 GPS: Navigation and remote mode

  Problem:    When working in remote mode, navigation will not work if
              the remote file system is not accessed directly.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-04-21

  Workaround: Launch manually (or via a plug-in) the gnatinspect command
              after each build.
