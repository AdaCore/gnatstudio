Known Problems fixed in GPS 6.1 / GNATbench 2.9
-----------------------------------------------

KP-60-N205-040 Wrong indentation of separate protected

  Problem:    Indentation of 'protected xxx is separate' constructs is not
              handled properly, causing an exra indentation level.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-02-06

  Workaround: Do not declare the protected object as separate.

KP-60-N205-018 GPS: get_executable_name is case sensitive

  Problem:    The python function get_executable_name does not work on Windows
              when a file has an upper-case name (because that names is lower
              cased internally by GPS, which therefore does not find the
              Main'Executable attribute for it in the project file)

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-02-06

  Workaround: Rename the file with lower cases.

KP-60-N127-011 GPS: Builder switch "--RTS=.../path/to/runtime_dir"

  Problem:    When in the main project the Builder switches include --RTS=
              with a relative path, GPS fails to load successfully the
              project.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-01-28

  Workaround: Avoid these Builder switches.

KP-60-N116-040 GPS: Completion mechanism crashes GPS

  Problem:    When using dynamic completion, in some specific scenario, the
              completion resolver for ada constructs would make GPS crash.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-01-17

  Workaround: Deactivate dynamic completion/don't use completion in that
              scenario.

KP-60-N109-027 GPS: incorrect display of abstract entities in entities browser

  Problem:    When an entity is an abstract record, its display in the
              browser duplicates all its fields, and does not list its
              methods.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-01-30

  Workaround: If you can edit sqlite database, you can do the following
              command on it (only needed the first time it is created, not
              every time it is updated):
                 sqlite3 root_object_dir/gnatinspect.db
                 > update entity_kinds set has_methods='t' where id='H';

KP-60-MC16-032 GPS: Source window not scrolling after auto complete

  Problem:    When auto-completing manually (via Ctrl+Space for example), if
              the cursor location after the completion is outside of the
              screen, then the source editor won't scroll to show the cursor.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-01-17

  Workaround: Scroll manually.

KP-60-MC13-038 GPS: MDI child "flicker" while being moved

  Problem:    When moving MDI childs between notebooks, some visual flickering
              was occuring.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-01-07

  Workaround: Keep using the drag&drop with the flickering, which is only a
              visual side effect.

KP-60-MC11-034 GPS: Block completions not working in all cases

  Problem:    The block completion plug-in was not working with simple begin
              blocks, generic packages, procedures and functions.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-01-12

  Workaround: Complete the blocks manually.

KP-60-MC09-035 GPS: Color problems with Open Text Exceed 14 X server

  Problem:    When using GPS through the Open Text Exceed 14 X server, all text
              and some widgets are rendered in white, regardless of the
              original color.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-01-30

  Workaround: Use another X Server (Cygwin's for example)

KP-60-MC05-001 GPS: Keyboard not working in editor's contextual menus

  Problem:    When in a contextual menu in the editor, keys would be grabbed by
              the editor rather than by the menu

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2013-12-09

  Workaround: Use the mouse to navigate the contextual menus

KP-60-MC04-015 GPS: doesn't launch after opening non-ASCII named file

  Problem:    When history of recently open files contains names with
              non-ASCII characters GPS sometime fails to start.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2013-12-05

  Workaround: Set UTF-8 locale before launching GPS.

KP-60-MB26-015 GB: Show complete command line in command line editor

  Problem:    When editing the command line before launching the action
              (ex: SPARK2014 > Prove Subprogram) the command line displayed at
              the bottom is incomplete.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9 on 2013-11-27

  Workaround: You can ignore this visual glitch.

KP-60-MB22-035 GPS: cannot launch browswer from GPS

  Problem:    Sometimes environment variables exported by GPS wrapper
              prevent the launch of browser.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-01-30

  Workaround: Write shell wrapper to launch browser in corrected environment.
              Then specify wrapper as browser command in GPS preferences.

KP-60-MB20-048 GB: code assist enable not applied to open editors

  Problem:    Enabling or disabling code assist from the preferences
              is not applied to open editors.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9 on 2013-11-25

  Workaround: Close and reopen the editor(s).

KP-60-MB15-050 GPS: Color Theme preference always says 'Custom'

  Problem:    If one changes color theme in GPS preferences the combobox
              display 'Custom' value.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-02-04

  Workaround: Just ignore combobox value.

KP-60-MB14-058 GPS: the 'next tag' action does not select the first item

  Problem:    In the Locations view, if the currently selected node is
              a file node, then using the 'next tag' action or the
              menu Navigate->Next Locations message will cause the
              second message node to be highlighted.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2013-11-14

  Workaround: Use the 'previous tag' action to visit the first node.

KP-60-MB13-062 GPS: key shortcuts not displayed in some Build menus

  Problem:    The key shortcuts are not displayed in some menus that
              are present under the Build toplevel menu.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2013-11-13

  Workaround: Use the key shortcut editor to see the corresponding shortcuts.

KP-60-MB06-009 GPS: 'add to extending project' hides existing files

  Problem:    If you load an extending project in GPS, there is a new
              contextual menu 'Add to extending project' which can be
              used to conveniently copy files from the extended project
              into the extending one. However, if the extending project
              was created manually and is not using the Source_Files
              attribute, the result is that the files that were visible
              before are no longer visible.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2013-11-18

  Workaround: edit the extending project and remove the Source_Files
              attribute.

KP-60-MB01-006 GPS: create_missing_dirs not working with trailing separators

  Problem:    The plugin create_missing_dirs.py does not create directories
              that are specified with a trailing directory separator.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2013-11-01

  Workaround: Create the directories manually, or remove the directory
              separator at the end of the directory specification.

KP-60-MA29-025 GPS: Search in a floating window

  Problem:    When having a floating window source editor open, as well as a
              non floating one, focusing on the floating and then using the
              search window to search into it would search in the non floating
              window.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2013-11-05

  Workaround: Clicking on the window two times will make the search work
              properly.

KP-60-MA29-023 GPS: Goto declaration/body with a floating window

  Problem:    When having a spec (ads) file open in a non floating window, and
              the corresponding body open in a floating window, using go-to
              body in the spec does not scroll to the corresponding location in
              the body.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2013-11-04

  Workaround: Use goto declaration/body with non floating windows.

KP-60-MA24-011 GB: UI freeze importing existing GNAT project

  Problem:    Sometimes when running menu "File => Import... => Ada => Existing
              GNAT Project" and when an imported folder already exists in the
              workspace's file system, the UI stops to respond.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9 on 2014-01-14

  Workaround: Kill GNATbench process and retry the operation. Before retrying
              the import operation, you may have to delete manually in the
              workspace's file system, the folders you want to import.

KP-60-M918-001 Wrong indentation of complex entry

  Problem:    When indenting entries with parametrized conditions as in
                entry Received when Arrived (From) is
              the indentation gets confused for the rest of the file.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-02-06

  Workaround: Fix the indentation manually, or avoid this construct.

KP-60-JC07-006 GPS: rsh leaving remote processes as zombies in remote mode.

  Problem:    When using GPS remote mode with rsh, it may happen that spawned
              remote processes are not properly terminated before the rsh
              connection is closed.
              This may lead to zombie processes remaining on the remote host.
              rsh support by GPS has now been deprecated, as rsh is not an
              active development anymore, and has been replaced by secure and
              more robust solutions such as ssh.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2013-10-31

  Workaround: Use ssh instead. If absolutely needed, you can re-enable rsh
              support by using the remote_rsh.py plugin, to be activated from
              the Tools->Plug-ins menu.

KP-60-G928-018 GPS: "center cursor on screen" scrolls horizontally

  Problem:    Using the "center cursor on screen" action causes unwanted
              horizontal scrolling in editors.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1 on 2014-11-05

  Workaround: Scroll manually.
