F925-002 Short titles for floating windows

  A new preference has been added to control titles used for floating windows.

  The preference can be changed in the Windows section of the Preferences
  dialog.

F716-001 Improve block navigation support (2007-03-18)

  Now the "Start Of Statement" or "End Of Statement" actions move to
  the enclosing block when the cursor is already at the start/end of
  the current statement instead of doing nothing.

F329-003 Fix of "use clause would make operation legal" messages (2007-04-20)

  Compiler messages "use clause would make operation legal" are now 
  automatically fixed by GPS, by adding the missing use clause to the file.

  variables with 'Class when relevant.

D914-005 Better feedback when build fails with no source location (2007-04-19)

  When using the Build>Run>Custom and Build>Make>Custom menus, it is now
