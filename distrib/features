New features in GPS 5.3.0 / GNATbench 2.8.0
-------------------------------------------

NF-53-M424-019 Improved indentation of conditional expressions (2013-05-17)

  Ada 2012 If-expressions and case-expressions are better handled by the
  indentation engine and in particular extra indentation levels are used for
  each case branch.

NF-53-M318-031 GB: warning editing files not part of a GB project (2013-05-13)

  When the Ada editor opens a file not part of a GNATbench project, a dialog is
  displayed to inform the user that some features will not work properly until
  the file is part of a GNATbench project.
  This dialog can be disabled through Ada Editor Preferences page.

NF-53-M315-025 WB: enable DFW_ENABLE_ADA_SYMBOL_CHECK at startup (2013-05-17)

  On Wind River Workbench 3.3 or later, Ada expressions watch feature requires
  DFW_ENABLE_ADA_SYMBOL_CHECK environment variable to be set to 1.
  If not set, Expressions view is not able to display current values of records
  and arrays variables.
  This feature can be disabled using Ada General preferences page.

NF-53-M205-030 ECL: navigation problems are announced (2013-05-24)

  When navigation functions, such as hyperlinks and goto-spec/body, encounter
  problems due to lack of compilation or use of foreign Ada source files, these
  problems are announced via warning and errors dialog boxes.  Users have the
  option to disable these dialogs with a checkbox on the dialogs themselves,
  for convenience.

NF-53-M204-035 ECL: automatic scenario set for Android projects (2013-02-04)

  When the new-project wizard creates a new Ada for Android project
  the "OS" scenario variable will be set to "linux" automatically.
  This setting is essential for creating proper library names for subsequent
  use by the Android OS.

NF-53-M129-023 GPS: simplified CodePeer report window (2013-03-11)

  The CodePeer report window has been simplified to improve usability and
  remove unneeded information. Access to the various filters is also
  improved.

NF-53-M129-002 GPS: return block completion (2013-02-04)

  Add "return ... end return;" statement support for complete block
  completion

NF-53-M109-036 GPS: autofix on missing constant with preferences (2013-01-21)

  Autofix has always done fixes in lowercases. This enhancement performs
  the fixes on missing constants following the user defined preferences
  specified in Preferences/Editor/Ada/Reserved word casing

NF-53-M102-006 GPS: move Serialize to /Edit/Rectangle/ (2013-01-11)

  This menu was previously in /Edit/Selection, but is more logical in the
  Rectangle submenu since it conceptually applies to a rectangle.

NF-53-LB20-022 GPS: Key shortcuts dialog display improved (2012-11-21)

  The display of the key shortcuts in this dialog now matches what is
  done for the toplevel menus, using symbols like up arrow for the shift
  key, a caret sign for the control key, and the special symbols for
  Mac keyboards.

NF-53-LB15-037 GPS: EditorOverlay can now highlight a whole line (2012-12-05)

  The EditorOverlay class can now be used in Python plugins to highlight an
  entire line, through the property "paragraph-background":
    # Create an overlay for an editor:
    b = GPS.EditorBuffer.get(GPS.File ("my_file.adb"))
    o = b.create_overlay("my_overlay_name")

    # Set the paragraph-background property to pink
    o.set_property ("paragraph-background", "#f0c0c0")

    # This highlights the entire line 317 in my file
    b.apply_overlay (o,
       GPS.EditorLocation(b, 317, 1),
       GPS.EditorLocation(b, 317, 1))

NF-53-LB04-004 GB: Export GNATbench preferences like CDT (2013-01-22)

  GNATbench preferences can now be exported via the export preferences wizard
  and imported into another workspace via the import preferences wizard.

NF-53-L926-027 GPS: Project, Files and Windows views pop-ups (2012-11-13)

  Tooltips added to views to help navigation when windows are narrow.

NF-53-L921-032 GPS: Show protected objects in Outline view (2012-10-16)

  Protected and task types/objects and their entries are now visible in
  Outline View. New filter in Outline View "Show tasks, entries, and protected
  types" is used to show/hide these items.

NF-53-L530-025 New cross-reference engine based on sqlite (2013-01-24)

   GPS and GNATbench both have a new xref engine, based on sqlite. This new
   engine is expected to bring extra performance (since the xref database
   becomes persistent across sessions and GPS will no longer need to parse ALI
   files on the fly), as well as more stability (by using an external process
   to fill the database, and relying on sqlite's very good stability).
   This engine is currently disabled by default, but can be enabled by adding
   a line "ENTITIES.SQLITES=yes" in $HOME/.gps/traces.cfg .

NF-53-J728-022 GPS: the Project Wizard takes advantage of gnatname (2012-11-08)

  The project wizard now optionally uses gnatname to search for Ada units in
  files with non-standard naming conventions.

NF-53-I430-029 GB: Show Ada content in Project Explorer view (2013-03-28)

  GNATbench now uses the Project Explorer view rather than the now deprecated
  GNAT Project Explorer view.  This is the standard view in Eclipse for viewing
  projects, folders, files, etc.  There's also a new view filter that can hide
  any folders/files that are not relevant to the current build configuration.
  Working sets are supported now as well.

NF-53-I424-031 GB: Ada elements now displayed in Properties view (2013-04-22)

  When any element contributed to the Project Explorer or Outline view by
  GNATbench is selected, you will now see properties of that element in the
  Properties view.

NF-53-I320-015 GB: Enhance block completions (2013-01-25)

  The block completion facility has been extended to cover additional
  constructs e.g. extended return statement, protected entry bodies,
  variant parts inside record declarations.

NF-53-G104-002 WB: Debug tooltip (2013-05-16)

  When debugging an ada application, if the mouse cursor is over a variable
  that can be printed by the debugger, the tooltip displays the variable
  current value. This feature requires WRWB 3.3 or later.
