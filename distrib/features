New features in GPS 3.1.0

- E525-008 Improved support for remote files
  If the user name on the remote machine wasn't specified, GPS will not let the
  underlying tool decide for itself. In particular, this adds support for ssh's
  config file.

- E516-025 New preference: Tooltip timeout
  This preferenced is used to specify the time before a tooltip is displayed
  in source editors.

- E404-002 The current location is saved when the user selects Goto Line,
  does a search, or jumps to a location through the Outline View or Locations
  Window. This way, it is easier to navigate back to the previous position

- DC03-011 New switch: --readonly
  This switch instructs GPS to open all files in read-only mode by default.
  This is particularly useful when used with --debug.

- BA07-005 Improved cross-references for generics
  From a reference to an entity declared in a generic, it is now possible to
  find out what instantiation of the generic is involved.

- Identifier completion is now case insensitive when the language itself is
  case insensitive. Possible completions are looked for in all open editors.

- Improved handling of tooltips in editors
  Tooltip now remains displayed while the mouse cursor stays on the hotspot
  word. Using the mousewheel to scroll now hides the tooltip.
  The list of parameters for subprograms is now displayed in the tooltip.
