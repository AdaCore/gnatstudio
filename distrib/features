New features in GPS 6.0.0 / GNATbench 2.8.0
-------------------------------------------

NF-53-M424-019 Improved indentation of conditional expressions (2013-05-17)

  Ada 2012 If-expressions and case-expressions are better handled by the
  indentation engine and in particular extra indentation levels are used for
  each case branch.

NF-60-M329-013 GPS: translucent highlighting colors (2013-03-29)

  It is now possible to specify translucent colors for error messages,
  current lines,... in the editors. This is a convenient solution so that
  the current line also shows whether it has an associated error.

NF-53-M318-031 GB: warning editing files not part of a GB project (2013-05-13)

  When the Ada editor opens a file not part of a GNATbench project, a dialog is
  displayed to inform the user that some features will not work properly until
  the file is part of a GNATbench project.
  This dialog can be disabled through Ada Editor Preferences page.

NF-60-M307-008 GPS: refactoring of highlighter.py (2013-03-27)

  This python module is used as the basis for all python scripts that need to
  highlight (part of) editors. In particular, you can easily extend it to
  highlight specific text or regular expressions in your buffer. This script
  now provides an OverlayStyle class, which supports more properties than
  before (in particular, you can strike through or underline specific text
  in your editors with just a few lines of code).

NF-53-M205-030 ECL: navigation problems are announced (2013-05-24)

  When navigation functions, such as hyperlinks and goto-spec/body, encounter
  problems due to lack of compilation or use of foreign Ada source files, these
  problems are announced via warning and errors dialog boxes.  Users have the
  option to disable these dialogs with a checkbox on the dialogs themselves,
  for convenience.

NF-53-M204-035 ECL: automatic scenario set for Android projects (2013-02-04)

  When the new-project wizard creates a new Ada for Android project
  the "OS" scenario variable will be set to "linux" automatically.
  This setting is essential for creating proper library names for subsequent
  use by the Android OS.

NF-53-M129-023 GPS: simplified CodePeer report window (2013-03-11)

  The CodePeer report window has been simplified to improve usability and
  remove unneeded information. Access to the various filters is also
  improved.

NF-53-M129-002 GPS: return block completion (2013-02-04)

  Add "return ... end return;" statement support for complete block
  completion

NF-60-M122-025 GPS: filter in the outline view (2013-01-23)

  A filter has been added to the Outline view to make it easier to find
  entities.

NF-60-M121-011 GPS: Outline has a flat view mode (2013-01-21)

  It is now possible to display all entities at the same level, rather than
  nested hierarchically. In some cases, it makes searching for an entity
  easier.

NF-60-M111-033 GPS: Refill automatically computes paragraph (2013-01-11)

  The menu /Edit/Selection/Refill will now either apply to the current
  selection if it exists (as before), or automatically compute the extents
  of the current paragraph to reformat (instead of only applying to the
  current line).

NF-60-M110-025 GPS: group spec and body in Outline view (2013-01-10)

  It is now possible to group the spec and body (or spec and full view) for an
  entity on the same row in the Outline view, to restrict the total height of
  the Outline view. Clicking on the name of the entity will jump to its spec,
  but if this is already the current location in the editor will jump to its
  body instead.

NF-53-M109-036 GPS: autofix on missing constant with preferences (2013-01-21)

  Autofix has always done fixes in lowercases. This enhancement performs
  the fixes on missing constants following the user defined preferences
  specified in Preferences/Editor/Ada/Reserved word casing

NF-60-M108-041 GPS: line wrapping in Messages window (2013-01-09)

  It is now possible to configure whether the Messages window should wrap
  lines, or require horizontal scrolling.

NF-53-M102-006 GPS: move Serialize to /Edit/Rectangle/ (2013-01-11)

  This menu was previously in /Edit/Selection, but is more logical in the
  Rectangle submenu since it conceptually applies to a rectangle.

NF-60-LC21-017 GPS: Update to Scenario View (2013-01-08)

  The Scenario view has been updated to a more usable tree rendering.

NF-60-LC06-024 GPS: Locations view has a toolbar (2012-12-06)

  Actions such as "clear locations", or the filter panel were now moved into
  that toolbar to make them more accessible. The preference "Auto Jump To First
  Location" was removed from the preferences menu and moved to the toolbar as
  well.

NF-60-LC06-015 GPS: tab menu allows easy selection of open tabs (2012-12-17)

  The right-click menu on notebook tabs now shows the list of all windows open
  in that tabs, to ease navigation.

NF-60-LC03-011 GPS: local toolbars for views (2012-12-03)

  A number of views now have a local toolbar. They also display their
  configuration settings in a local menu rather than in the Preferences
  dialog or the contextual menu.

NF-60-LB29-021 GPS: remove status bar (2012-11-29)

  The status bar has been removed. It was only used to display the current
  tasks in progress, and the corresponding progress bars were moved to the
  right of the toolbar, replacing the throbber.

NF-60-LB29-006 GPS: use ellipsis in window titles (2012-11-28)

  The text in the title bars and in the notebook tabs will now use ellipsis
  ("...") when the window is too small to accomodate the whole text. The size
  of notebook tabs is also limited so that we do not end up with a single tab
  using most of the notebook widths, thus hidding the others. This behavior
  is controlled by a new preference Window/Homogeneous Tabs.

NF-60-LB26-025 GPS: clickable qualified name in editor status bars (2012-12-13)

  The name of the current subprogram, as displayed in the editors status bars,
  now includes the name of the enclosing subprograms and packages. Each of
  these names is clickable to easily jump to the beginning of the enclosing
  block.

NF-53-LB20-022 GPS: Key shortcuts dialog display improved (2012-11-21)

  The display of the key shortcuts in this dialog now matches what is
  done for the toplevel menus, using symbols like up arrow for the shift
  key, a caret sign for the control key, and the special symbols for
  Mac keyboards.

NF-53-LB15-037 GPS: EditorOverlay can now highlight a whole line (2012-12-05)

  The EditorOverlay class can now be used in Python plugins to highlight an
  entire line, through the property "paragraph-background":
    # Create an overlay for an editor:
    b = GPS.EditorBuffer.get(GPS.File ("my_file.adb"))
    o = b.create_overlay("my_overlay_name")

    # Set the paragraph-background property to pink
    o.set_property ("paragraph-background", "#f0c0c0")

    # This highlights the entire line 317 in my file
    b.apply_overlay (o,
       GPS.EditorLocation(b, 317, 1),
       GPS.EditorLocation(b, 317, 1))

NF-53-LB04-004 GB: Export GNATbench preferences like CDT (2013-01-22)

  GNATbench preferences can now be exported via the export preferences wizard
  and imported into another workspace via the import preferences wizard.

NF-53-L926-027 GPS: Project, Files and Windows views pop-ups (2012-11-13)

  Tooltips added to views to help navigation when windows are narrow.

NF-53-L921-032 GPS: Show protected objects in Outline view (2012-10-16)

  Protected and task types/objects and their entries are now visible in
  Outline View. New filter in Outline View "Show tasks, entries, and protected
  types" is used to show/hide these items.

NF-53-L530-025 New cross-reference engine based on sqlite (2013-01-24)

   GPS and GNATbench both have a new xref engine, based on sqlite. This new
   engine is expected to bring extra performance (since the xref database
   becomes persistent across sessions and GPS will no longer need to parse ALI
   files on the fly), as well as more stability (by using an external process
   to fill the database, and relying on sqlite's very good stability).
   This engine is currently disabled by default, but can be enabled by adding
   a line "ENTITIES.SQLITES=yes" in $HOME/.gps/traces.cfg .

NF-53-J728-022 GPS: the Project Wizard takes advantage of gnatname (2012-11-08)

  The project wizard now optionally uses gnatname to search for Ada units in
  files with non-standard naming conventions.

NF-53-I430-029 GB: Show Ada content in Project Explorer view (2013-03-28)

  GNATbench now uses the Project Explorer view rather than the now deprecated
  GNAT Project Explorer view.  This is the standard view in Eclipse for viewing
  projects, folders, files, etc.  There's also a new view filter that can hide
  any folders/files that are not relevant to the current build configuration.
  Working sets are supported now as well.

NF-53-I424-031 GB: Ada elements now displayed in Properties view (2013-04-22)

  When any element contributed to the Project Explorer or Outline view by
  GNATbench is selected, you will now see properties of that element in the
  Properties view.

NF-53-I320-015 GB: Enhance block completions (2013-01-25)

  The block completion facility has been extended to cover additional
  constructs e.g. extended return statement, protected entry bodies,
  variant parts inside record declarations.

NF-60-H603-006 GPS: Aliases auto completion (2013-04-11)
  
  Aliases can now be completed and expanded by the regular auto-completion
  mechanism.

NF-60-H605-006 GPS: Visual indication of completions accessibility (2013-04-16)

  In smart completions, entities that are not accessible in the context
  of the completion are now shown in grey.

NF-53-G104-002 WB: Debug tooltip (2013-05-16)

  When debugging an ada application, if the mouse cursor is over a variable
  that can be printed by the debugger, the tooltip displays the variable
  current value. This feature requires WRWB 3.3 or later.
