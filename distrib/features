New features on 4.5.0
---------------------

NF-45-IB10-017 Auto fix for "no space allowed" (2009-11-16)

   Messages "no space allowed" are now auto-fixed by gps.

NF-45-IA13-016 New menu /File/Close All Editors Except Current (2009-10-14)

  This menu closes all editors except the one that currently has the focus.

NF-45-IA01-003 New plugin: selection_highlighter.py (2009-10-12)

  When some text is selected in a buffer, this plugin will automatically
  highlight other occurrences of the selected text in the buffer.

NF-45-I922-014 Fewer system calls for cross-references (2009-09-29)

  The number of system calls performed when loading the cross-reference
  information from the disk (the .ali files) has been significantly
  reduced. This results in a speed up, especially noticeable when using
  sources from a remote server.

NF-45-I810-019 Remote mode now synchronizes files upon save (2009-10-28)

  When using the GPS remote mode, locally saved files are now synchronized
  to the remote servers immediately. This allows external programs running
  on the server to immediately have access to them, and also allows faster
  sync operations before GPS launches an action on the remote server.
