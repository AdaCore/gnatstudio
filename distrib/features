New features on 4.5.0
---------------------

NF-45-IC10-030 Better emulation of Emacs's split features (2009-12-10)

  If you loaded the emacs.xml plugin, the control-x 2 and control-x 3 key
  shortcuts will now better emulate Emacs, and create new views of the
  editors, and properly reuse existing notebooks rather than create new
  ones

NF-45-IC04-030 Auto-fix for "warning, var is unreferenced" (2009-12-09)

  When the compiler detects that a variable with a pragma unreferenced is
  used, and issue a warning, an auto-fix is now automatically offered.

NF-45-IC01-026 Auto-fix for unexpected tilde or percent in SPARK (2009-12-02)

  Semantic errors 317, 318, 319, 320 and 321 raised by SPARK Examiner complain
  about an unexpected or misplaced tilde or percent. An auto-fix for such
  errors is offered, which consists either in removing the offending tilde or
  percent, or in replacing it correctly.

NF-45-IB20-006 Better fixes for undefined entities (2009-11-20)

  Problems such as "entity is undefined" can now be provided with an auto-fix
  even if the compiler didn't find any potential match. A fix is offered if
  there is a unique entity in the project of the appropriate name.

NF-45-IB15-005 Apply multiple code fixes at once (2009-11-23)

  A new menu "Auto-fix" is now available when right clicking on an error
  message associated with a fix, allowing the user to apply fixes to multiple
  messages at once.

NF-45-IB10-017 Auto fix for "no space allowed" (2009-11-16)

  Messages "no space allowed" are now auto-fixed by gps.

NF-45-IB10-011 New contextual menu "Close all other editors (2009-11-17)

  When right-clicking on a notebook tab of an editor, a new contextual
  menu entry is shown, to close all other open editors

NF-45-IA27-021 Support for perspectives (2009-11-30)

  GPS's Multiple Document Interface now supports perspectives. These are
  activity-specific desktops (for instance one dedicated to debugging
  sessions, one to VCS operations,...) with their own set of windows. But
  editors are always visible in all of these, so switching to another
  perspective does not lose your current work.

NF-45-IA23-015 Warn when assigning existing shortcut to action (2009-11-18)

  In the /Edit/Key Shortcuts dialog, a warning is now displayed when you
  try to reassign an existing key binding to another action

NF-45-IA13-016 New menu /File/Close All Editors Except Current (2009-10-14)

  This menu closes all editors except the one that currently has the focus.

NF-45-IA01-003 New plugin: selection_highlighter.py (2009-10-12)

  When some text is selected in a buffer, this plugin will automatically
  highlight other occurrences of the selected text in the buffer.

NF-45-I922-014 Fewer system calls for cross-references (2009-09-29)

  The number of system calls performed when loading the cross-reference
  information from the disk (the .ali files) has been significantly
  reduced. This results in a speed up, especially noticeable when using
  sources from a remote server.

NF-45-I810-019 Remote mode now synchronizes files upon save (2009-10-28)

  When using the GPS remote mode, locally saved files are now synchronized
  to the remote servers immediately. This allows external programs running
  on the server to immediately have access to them, and also allows faster
  sync operations before GPS launches an action on the remote server.
