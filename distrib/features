  Perl, Tcl, Pascal, unix shell,...

- New menus Edit->Sort Ascending and Edit->Sort Descending

- New refactoring module: Rename entity, Name parameters in call,
  Extract Method.

- New python API for interacting with the editors
  See EditorBuffer, EditorView, ...

- Improved documentation for Python Extensions

- E525-008 Improved support for remote files
  If the user name on the remote machine wasn't specified, GPS will now let the
  underlying tool decide for itself. In particular, this adds support for ssh's
  config file.

- E516-025 New preference: Tooltip timeout
  This preference is used to specify the time before a tooltip is displayed
  in source editors.

- E510-024 Editing specific list of source files for projects

- E414-009 Enhancements in the Locations View.
   - Reorganize the layout to improve use of the screen space
   - Highlight the matching pattern in the search results
   - Add contextual menus to collapse or expand the view

- E404-002 The current location is saved when the user selects Goto Line,
  does a search, or jumps to a location through the Outline View or Locations
  Window. This way, it is easier to navigate back to the previous position

- E303-018 Improved assembly view
  The source line (set of assembly lines) where the program is stopped, as
  well as the program counter are materialized by special highlightings.
  It is also possible to scroll the assembly view horizontally.

- E218-027 New project attribute to chose the name of the GNAT driver on the
  machine, in particular when pretty printing and generating bodies

- E202-013 Support for bookmarks

- DC03-011 New switch: --readonly
  This switch instructs GPS to open all files in read-only mode by default.
  This is particularly useful when used with --debug.

- DC03-006 Improved indentation of multiple-line Ada constructs

- D825-010 Call graph can now be displayed in the Locations window

- D122-006 Support for VCS Activities
  A way to handle multiple files and do atomic commit and commit with a shared
  log if the external VCS supports it.

- C807-008 Export graphs to SVG so that people can import them into
  other tools.

- BA07-005 Improved cross-references for generics
  From a reference to an entity declared in a generic, it is now possible to
  find out what instantiation of the generic is involved.

- Improved identifier completion
  Completion is now case insensitive when the language itself is case
  insensitive.
  Possible completions are looked for in all open editors.

- Improved handling of tooltips in editors
  Tooltip now remains displayed while the mouse cursor stays on the hotspot
  word. Using the mousewheel to scroll hides the tooltip.
  The list of parameters for subprograms is displayed in the tooltip.
  Tooltips also show information about generics instantiations, as well as
  the proper casing of Ada entities.

- Improved MDI, better at reloading your desktop
