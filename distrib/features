New features in GPS 3.2.0

- Projects;
  - EB23-004: New attribute in Project Properties: externally_built

- Handling of desktops:
  - EB18-006 The size and position of the GPS window are now specific to each
    saved project, and thus the default desktop can use a size other than the
    one you use when developing.
  - EB17-011 It is now possible to modify the default desktop for all users
  - EA18-018 The default desktop is never saved automatically anymore. This
    allows you to define it once and for all, and keep the automatic saving of
    desktops for project-specific desktops
  - EA14-023 The Scenario View is back in the default desktop
