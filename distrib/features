New features in GPS 5.1.0 / GNATbench 2.6.0
-------------------------------------------

NF-51-K628-037 Extend quick fix support for 'Valid (2011-07-01)

  The automatic code fixing capability has been enhanced to handle
  the replacement of "not in" by 'Valid. For example, the expression
  "X not in T'Range" is replaced by "not X'Valid".

NF-51-K518-001 GPS: Improve creation of new files (2011-05-20)

  GPS now proposes to store new files in a more user friendly way. The
  default directory to create the file depends on the context. So for
  example if a specific directory is selected into the project explorer
  the File->New action will record this location. This specific location
  will then be proposed by default when doing File->Save.

NF-51-K430-002 GPS: Improve support on refilling comments (2011-05-08)

  Edit->Selection->Refill has been improved to search for comments in the
  selected lines and refill them using an algorithm that, after refilling
  the contents of the comment, compares adjacent lines and decides whether
  a word should be moved to the next line to make the lines more even.

NF-51-K428-011 GPS: Reduce needs for status update in VCS (2011-05-28)

  GPS now takes advantage of Subversion commit output to update the
  file statuses. This avoids the need of running a query status after
  a commit action. This is motivated by the fact that Subversion status
  may be really slow across network.

NF-51-K422-015 GPS: General GUI cleanup (2011-05-12)

  Many graphical elements of the GPS interface have been refreshed. In
  particular:
  - The close buttons in the title bars have been changed, and tabs now contain
    a close button.
  - The Search view has been also modified to present search options in a
    clearer and nicer way.
  - The browsers have been refreshed, with some added capabilities such as the
    capability to export to PDF, and a more complete export to SVG.
  - The different Combo boxes used in GPS have been reviewed, and their
    appearance now correctly reflects whether they can be edited or not.

NF-51-K412-030 GPS: Add support to align on renames keyword (2011-04-17)

  The align plug-in has been enhanced to align on renames keyword.

NF-51-K406-021 GPS: Support for more assembly languages (2011-04-06)

  GPS now supports languages "Asm_Cpp" (file extension .S by default) and
  "Asm2" (.asm) to be in line with the languages recognized by gprbuild.
  The language "Asm" (.s files) was already supported in GPS 5.0.

NF-51-K404-031 Quick fix support for 'First .. 'Last (2011-07-01)

  The automatic code fixing capability has been enhanced to replace
  occurrences of T'first .. T'last by T'Valid.

NF-51-K225-033 GPS: New menu Debug->Display <expanded name> (2011-02-27)

  As part of the optional debugger.py plug-in, a new menu is provided when
  debugging which allows displaying of a variable by its fully expanded
  name (e.g. Ada.Text_IO.Status_Error vs Status_Error) to make it easier
  in some cases to print contents of a variable.

NF-51-K224-003 Add support for Ada 2012 in the project editor (2011-02-28)

  Add support for the -gnat12 switch in the project editor.

NF-51-K216-038 GB: New Insert Unit Comment Box action (2011-02-16)

  A new command for inserting a comment box containing the unit
  name has been added.  Subprograms, entries, packages, and
  protected objects are supported. This command works exactly
  like the "Insert Subprogram Box" command in GPS.

NF-51-K215-022 New menu Tools->Views->Messages (2011-02-16)

  This menu brings up the Messages window.

NF-51-K209-048 New plugin to prevent project edition (2011-02-15)

  A new plugin "prevent_project_edition.py", inactive by default,
  prevents graphical edition of projects from GPS. This is useful in
  contexts where the project files are hand-written and their formatting
  should be preserved.

NF-51-K204-022 Use project's gnatls for default project path (2011-03-02)

  The IDEs will now check the project's IDE.Gnatlist attribute to query the
  default project path (instead of always running the native "gnatls").
  This allows a project to depend on a project only available for cross
  platforms (for instance "zfp_support.gpr").

NF-51-K202-008 Improved indentation of Ada 2012 constructs (2011-02-03)

  Ada 2012 Expression functions and aspects are now better recognized and
  indented by the internal Ada parser.

NF-51-K128-036 GPS: Add support to align on comas (2011-02-19)

  The align plug-in has been enhanced to align on comas.

NF-51-K121-032 Extend support for redundant conversion (2011-05-20)

  The automatic code fixing capability has been enhanced to support removing
  redundant conversion automatically.

NF-51-K121-029 Extend support for redundant with clauses (2011-05-19)

  The automatic code fixing capability has been enhanced to support removing
  redundant "with" clauses.

NF-51-K113-012 GPS: improvements in createfile.py plug-in (2011-01-13)

  The dialog provided by this plug-in has been improved and the file created
  now appears automatically in the project view.

NF-51-K112-013 GPS: user defined database directory for CodePeer (2011-03-29)

  CodePeer plug-in allows to define output and database directories as
  project's attributes. This is useful for example for sharing the database
  between users.

NF-51-JC10-012 GPS: "short titles" pref applies to docked windows (2010-12-13)

  This preference used to only have an effect on floating windows, but will
  now also force docked windows to use short titles (in particular base names
  for file editors).

NF-51-JB30-015 GPS: new zap-to-char and just-one-space actions (2010-12-01)

  These actions complete the Emacs emulation in GPS, and have the same
  behavior as in Emacs. See the Key Shortcuts menu for more information.

NF-51-JB26-007 GB: Improve spell checking feature in ada editor (2010-12-16)

  Under Eclipse, the spell checking now only considers comments and string
  literals. String literals spell checking can be disabled using the check box
  "Ignore string literals when spell checking" accessible from menu Window =>
  Preferences => Ada => Editor.

NF-51-JB23-022 GB: Add tooltips in ada editor (2010-12-08)

  GNATbench now displays tooltips for entities in the editor, showing their
  profile and documentation. They can be disabled from the menu Window =>
  Preferences => Ada => Editor.

NF-51-JB18-031 GPS: New API to retrieve multiple files in contexts (2010-12-10)

  A new Python/Shell API (FileContext.files) allows retrieving as a list all
  files stored in a context. This is useful in particular when working with
  the VCS Explorer.

NF-51-JB16-016 GPS: New facility for handling VCS menus (2010-12-10)

  GPS provides a facility for handling all VCS menus in a centralized place,
  allowing customization of the layout of all VCS menus, both for systems
  that are supported out-of-the-box in GPS, and for custom VCS.

NF-51-JB05-015 GB: Add some jdt-equivalent key shortcuts (2010-11-05)

  Some shortcuts defined in JDT or CDT for toggling comments have been added
  to gnatbench (Ctrl+Shift+C and Ctrl+7).

NF-51-JA25-028 Improved indentation of continuation lines (2011-03-22)

  Continuation lines starting or ending with the '&' operator are better
  handled by the indentation engine and as a result, automatic indentation
  of such lines is improved.

NF-51-JA25-016 GPS: ispell module stops at underscores (2010-11-05)

  When looking for the word to spell check, the ispell.py module will now
  stop at '_' characters, thus allowing you to fix misspelling in words like
  'lookng_for'

NF-51-J805-009 Based literals not auto cased (2010-10-17)

  Auto-casing now keeps based literals with their original casing rather than
  applying automatic casing as done for e.g. identifiers.

NF-51-J725-004 Add support for sorting on rectangle selections (2011-01-12)

  It is now possible to sort on rectangular selections. The column range
  on the rectangular selection is used to get the key on each line on which
  lines are sorted. Sorting in both ascending and descending order are
  supported.

NF-51-J616-028 GB: new menu entry for invoking gpr project editor (2011-02-17)

  A new menu entry is defined for invoking the gpr textual editor on a
  project's gpr file, without first requiring the corresponding node to
  be located in the GNAT Project Explorer. The new entry appears under
  the "GNAT Project" main menu in the contextual menus on project nodes
  in the GNAT Project Explorer and is titled "Edit GPR File". The command
  is available both for the root project node and for any dependent
  projects' nodes.

NF-51-J302-028 GPS: Separate filters for CodePeer warnings/checks (2011-05-31)

  GPS now provides separate filters for CodePeer warnings and checks.

NF-51-IB24-029 GB: Independent entries in Problems view (2011-02-28)

  When a tool inserts entries into the Problems view, those entries will remain
  until either removed by a subsequent successful run of the same tool, or
  removed manually.  Each entry indicates the distinct tool that inserted it.

NF-51-I618-021 GPS: Add support for sorting the process list (2011-02-16)

  The process list can now be sorted based on the pid or the command. This
  makes it easier to find a specific process in the list. At the same time,
  the process list now contains only the actual command for better
  readability.

NF-51-I617-011 GPS: Add total/passed checks counters for CodePeer (2011-04-28)

  CodePeer Summary Report has been extended to display total/passed checks
  counters for each file and project.

NF-51-I128-011 GPS: save CodePeer filter settings between sessions (2011-02-17)

  GPS saves CodePeer Summary Report's filter settings between sessions.

NF-51-GA03-018 GPS: Project View uses a case-insensitive sort (2010-10-17)

  Entries (project, package, subprogram, types names) in the Project
  View are now sorted ignoring the casing, which is in general more user
  friendly.

NF-51-G823-005 GPS: Leave codefix wrench for readonly files (2010-10-26)

  When an auto fix is applied on a readonly file, the wrench icon does not
  disappear and an error message is added in the Messages window.

NF-51-G820-002 GB: New navigation buttons to ada elements (2011-03-03)

  Add "Open Specification" and if any, "Open Body" buttons to the ada
  element's documentation tooltip view toolbar.
  This view is displayed by the ada editor as ada element's tooltip or as
  ada content assist proposal element's documentation. The view's toolbar is
  displayed after the view is mouse clicked.
