New features in GPS 5.2.0 / GNATbench 2.7.0
-------------------------------------------

NF-52-L521-019 GPS: Minimal scrolling when jumping to a location (2012-05-21)

  The scrolling that occurs when going to an editor location is slightly
  less intrusive, scrolling minimally to reveal the location plus a bit of
  margin rather than centering on the location.

NF-52-L514-028 GPS: Action tooltip in Locations view (2012-05-21)

  The Locations View now displays a tooltip for the action associated with a
  message.

NF-52-L416-043 GB: Improved search results interaction (2012-04-16)

  When a non-nested entry is selected in the search results, the editor is now
  opened on the first enclosed match rather than on the enclosing construct
  itself.  For example, if one or more references occur to the intended entity
  within a subprogram, the subprogram name is the entry in the results, rather
  than each enclosed match being given a distinct entry. Selecting the entry
  for the subprogram will no longer open the editor on the subprogram name in
  the declaration. It will open the editor at the first enclosed reference.

NF-52-L416-019 GPS: improve batch codefix support (2012-05-03)

  GPS now provides the ability to fix automatically similar errors in batch
  mode when multiple choices available.

NF-52-L329-026 GPS: Improved emacs selection mode support (2012-03-30)

  When using the emacs mode, after setting a mark, the commands to go to the
  beginning and end of line will extend the selection.

NF-52-L329-021 GPS: isearch.py stores result of ctrl+w in history (2012-03-29)

  When you start a search (ctrl+s) and then use ctrl+w to copy parts of the
  current identifier as the search pattern, this pattern is now stored
  immediately in the history. That way, cancelling the search and restarting
  it with ctrl+s ctrl+s will search what was copied (we used to update the
  pattern only after you pressed ctrl+s a second time after ctrl+w).
  This is closer to Emacs' behavior.

NF-52-L327-003 GPS: displaying metrics in GPS (2012-05-17)

  The GPS is able to reopen the Metrics view from the Tools->View->Metrics
  menu.

NF-52-L320-004 GPS: simplify Default Builder preference (2012-03-20)

  The Default Builder preference has been simplified, with the following
  changes:
    - 'Gprmake' setting removed, since gprmake is no longer supported;
    - 'Gprbuild' setting renamed 'Auto', more accurate;
    - 'Gprbuild_Always' setting renamed 'Gprbuild', for consistency with the
      'Gnatmake' setting.

  Note that if you were using a non default setting for this preference, you
  will need to reset it manually.

NF-52-L227-030 GB: project names need not be legal Ada identifiers (2012-03-09)

  The name of an Eclipse/Workbench project need not conform to the rules for
  Ada identifiers.  This change applies to both new projects and as well as
  existing Eclipse/Workbench projects to be converted to GNATbench use.

NF-52-L213-028 GPS: new command GPS.EditorLocation.inside_word (2012-02-13)

  A new Shell/Python command allows determining whether a location is inside a
  word. This is useful when creating editor plugins.

NF-52-L211-002 GPS: wildcard support in Open From Project (2012-04-09)

  Wildcard characters are now taken into account in the "Open From Project..."
  dialog.

NF-52-L124-025 GPS: improvements in auto_highlight_occurrences.py (2012-02-16)

  The plugin auto_highlight_occurrences.py has two new features:
    - if there is a selection, the other occurrences of the selected text
      will be highlighted in the editor
    - if the cursor is on a word which is not a navigable entity (for instance
      keywords, words in comments, or in languages other than Ada or C), GPS
      will perform a text-based highlighting of this word

  Both of these behaviors can be deactivated through the Preferences dialog,
  section Plugins->auto_highlight_occurrences.

NF-52-L120-062 GB: set actual name of main in debug config (2012-05-16)

  Newly created debug configurations now set the default breakpoint to the
  procedure of the main executable rather than simply "main".

NF-52-L109-019 GPS: goto next/previous bookmark (2012-01-23)

  Two new actions ("Goto Next Bookmark" and "Goto Previous Bookmark") are
  available to jump to nearest bookmarks in current file.
  They can be bound to keys in the "General" section of the Key Shortcuts
  dialog.

NF-52-L109-016 GPS: New action "Delete Line" (2012-01-11)

  This action deletes the current line and places the cursor on the beginning
  of the following line.
  It can be bound to a key in the "Editor" section of the Key Shortcuts dialog.

NF-52-L101-003 GB: display task info in debug view (2012-01-10)

  Ada task information is now displayed in the debug view.  This feature can
  be enabled/disabled from the debug view menu.

  GPS is now licensed under the terms of the GPL version 3.

NF-52-KC07-036 GPS: doc converted to sphinx (2011-12-08)

  The documentation format was changed, so that we can produce nicer
  looking output. In particular, the new format provides an integrated
  search feature over all pages of the manual.

NF-52-KA28-027 GPS: new Editor action "toggle wrapping" (2011-10-28)

  A new action "toggle wrapping" is defined in the plugin text_utils.py,
  and can be associated to a key binding in the Key Shortcuts editor to
  conveniently switch between no wrapping and word wrapping in the current
  editor.

NF-52-KA27-013 GPS: improved smart completion on C/C++ (2012-05-20)

  GPS incorporates support to analyze the context and provide better
  proposals for smart completion of C/C++ entities, including cases
  like: x.field, x->field, x.method, x->method, x[...][...]->field,
  x[...][...]->method, and class::method.

  GPS also proposes smart completion of parameters in function and method
  calls. The name of the formals is added as C comments to facilitate adding
  the actuals. For example: "obj.copy (/* target */  , /* source */  )"

NF-52-KA03-005 GPS: force use of gprbuild (2011-12-06)

  It is now possible to always use gprbuild as a builder for projects,
  whether these projects are multi-language or not. This is done via the
  new preference 'Default builder', using the 'Gprbuild_Always' setting.
  This preference replaces the previous 'Multi language builder' preference.

NF-52-K907-014 GPS: Navigation from Ada to C++ (2011-10-26)

  GPS now incorporates support for navigating through Ada entities imported
  from C++.

NF-52-K401-026 Quick fix alternative for unreferenced objects (2011-10-31)

  Two alternatives are now suggested to quick fix an unreferenced object:
  either remove the object declaration or add a pragma unreferenced.

  Comments within expressions or as part of continuation lines are better
  indented, taking the extra continuation line preference into account.

  file containing errors is committed successfully or reverted.

  blank lines at end of file when saving editors.

NF-52-JA26-020 Improved indentation in parenthesized exprs (2012-02-20)

  'or else' and 'and then' constructs at the end of lines inside parenthesized
  expressions are better intended and in particular no longer generate an
  extra indentation on the next line.

NF-52-I527-048 GPS: multi-line option in MDI.input_dialog (2012-02-01)

  The GPS function MDI.input_dialog used in plug-ins has been enhanced and
