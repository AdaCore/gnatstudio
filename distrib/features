  for easier navigation and visualization.

NF-50-J720-004 More precise call graph (2010-08-06)

  When using a recent version of GNAT (starting with 2010-08-06), GPS

  sometimes ambiguous which editor has the focus.

NF-50-J628-017 Project-aware Locations history (2010-07-05)

  GPS's Multiple Document Interface now supports perspectives. These are
  activity-specific desktops (for instance one dedicated to debugging
  sessions, one to VCS operations,...) with their own set of windows. But
  editors are always visible in all of these, so switching to another
  perspective does not lose your current work.

  to the remote servers immediately. This allows external programs running
  on the server to immediately have access to them, and also allows faster
  sync operations before GPS launches an action on the remote server.

  provide in general a much better source navigation experience.

NF-50-H208-025 Warning displayed when editing read-only editors (2010-06-23)

  When trying to insert text in a read-only editor, GPS will display a warning
  in the Messages window.
