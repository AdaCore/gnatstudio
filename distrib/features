New features in GPS 6.0.0 / GNATbench 2.8.0
-------------------------------------------

NF-60-LC06-024 GPS: Locations view has a toolbar (2012-12-06)

  Actions such as "clear locations", or the filter panel were now moved into
  that toolbar to make them more accessible. The preference "Auto Jump To First
  Location" was removed from the preferences menu and moved to the toolbar as
  well.

NF-60-LC03-011 GPS: local toolbars for views (2012-12-03)

  A number of views now have a local toolbar. They also display their
  configuration settings in a local menu rather than in the Preferences
  dialog or the contextual menu.

NF-60-LB29-021 GPS: remove status bar (2012-11-29)

  The status bar has been removed. It was only used to display the current
  tasks in progress, and the corresponding progress bars were moved to the
  right of the toolbar, replacing the throbber.

NF-60-LB29-006 GPS: use ellipsis in window titles (2012-11-28)

  The text in the title bars and in the notebook tabs will now use ellipsis
  ("...") when the window is too small to accomodate the whole text. The size
  of notebook tabs is also limited so that we do not end up with a single tab
   using most of the notebook widths, thus hidding the others.

NF-60-LB26-025 GPS: clickable qualified name in editor status bars (2012-12-13)

  The name of the current subprogram, as displayed in the editors status bars,
  now includes the name of the enclosing subprograms and packages. Each of
  these names is clickable to easily jump to the beginning of the enclosing
  block.

NF-53-LB20-022 GPS: Key shortcuts dialog display improved (2012-11-21)

  The display of the key shortcuts in this dialog now matches what is
  done for the toplevel menus, using symbols like up arrow for the shift
  key, a caret sign for the control key, and the special symbols for
  Mac keyboards.

NF-53-LB15-037 GPS: EditorOverlay can now highlight a whole line (2012-12-05)

  The EditorOverlay class can now be used in Python plugins to highlight an
  entire line, through the property "paragraph-background":
    # Create an overlay for an editor:
    b = GPS.EditorBuffer.get(GPS.File ("my_file.adb"))
    o = b.create_overlay("my_overlay_name")

    # Set the paragraph-background property to pink
    o.set_property ("paragraph-background", "#f0c0c0")

    # This highlights the entire line 317 in my file
    b.apply_overlay (o,
       GPS.EditorLocation(b, 317, 1),
       GPS.EditorLocation(b, 317, 1))

NF-53-L926-027 GPS: Project, Files and Windows views pop-ups (2012-11-13)

  Tooltips added to views to help navigation when windows are narrow.

NF-53-L921-032 GPS: Show protected objects in Outline view (2012-10-16)

  Protected and task types/objects and their entries are now visible in
  Outline View. New filter in Outline View "Show tasks, entries, and protected
  types" is used to show/hide these items.

NF-53-J728-022 GPS: the Project Wizard takes advantage of gnatname (2012-11-08)

  The project wizard now optionally uses gnatname to search for Ada units in
  files with non-standard naming conventions.
