New features in GPS 4.2.0
-------------------------

NF-42-G611-029 Specifying "recursive" directory status for VCS (2006-06-18)

  It is now possible, in custom XML files, to specify an action to query
  the status of a directory and subdirectories recursively, which GPS calls
  instead of launching separate queries for each directory. The provided
  Subversion plug-in benefits from this improvement.

NF-42-G608-016 Avoiding hidden directories in VCS operations (2007-06-11)

  The VCS operations "Query status for directory recursively" and "Update
  directory recursively" now take into account the Preference "Hidden
  directories pattern" (in the "Project" section) and do not perform VCS
  operations on hidden or special directories.

NF-42-G608-003 Grouping VCS queries for better performance (2007-06-11)

  It is now possible to configure VCS so that, when querying status for all
  files, the VCS performs "query status for directories" on each source
  directory instead of file-by-file queries. This is activated by default, and
  can be controlled on the VCS that are described through XML files.

NF-42-G526-001 Performance improvements with highlighted lines (2007-06-15)

  The speed of operations involving the creation or the removal of line
  highlighting (such as the visual file differences) has been improved.

NF-42-G517-005 Makefile.py now also provides support for ant (2007-06-01)

  The "ant" build system is now supported as a GPS plug-in. The support
  is similar to what already existed for makefiles, and is available through
  the same plug-in. See extended documentation through /Tools/Plug-ins menu.

NF-42-G515-006 Refactoring now detects read-only files (2007-05-31)

  When refactoring (in particular when renaming an entity), a dialog is
  displayed to warn about read-only files that cannot be refactored. The
  user is then given the choice of refactoring the others anyway, or
  cancelling the operation

NF-42-G509-011 New contextual menu to build libraries (2007-05-12)

  It is now possible to build individual libraries directly from the
  Build project's contextual menu on the Project View.

NF-42-G502-004 Ignore leading spaces in <external> (2007-05-09)

  If you specify an external command to execute in an XML file, you can now
  have leading spaces if you wish. This allows you to split the contents of
  the <external> tag on several lines.

NF-42-G307-006 File & Dirs operations from file and project views (2007-03-14)

  File & directories can now be manipulated (created, renamed, deleted) from
  the contextual menu of the project and file views.

NF-42-G223-014 Display full names in entity browser (2007-03-09)

  Entities in the entity browsers are now identified with their full names
  XXX.YYY.ZZZ instead of their simple names ZZZ.

NF-42-G213-014 Add support for Project Explorer filters (2007-02-20)

  It is now possible to filter out directories on the Project
  Explorer based on a given regular expression. This has been
  designed to filter out version control specific directories
  like CVS or .svn for example.

NF-42-FA12-012 Recent chosen completions displayed at top of list (2007-05-23)

  The completion window now remembers recently chosen completions, and will
  propose them at the top of the completion proposal list, when they are
  accurate.

NF-42-F925-002 Short titles for floating windows (2007-04-18)

  A new preference has been added to control titles used for floating windows.
  It is now possible to specify whether short or normal titles should be used.
  In particular, base file names can be used for editors instead of full names.
  The preference can be changed in the Windows section of the Preferences
  dialog.

NF-42-F716-001 Improve block navigation support (2007-03-18)

  Now the "Start Of Statement" or "End Of Statement" actions move to
  the enclosing block when the cursor is already at the start/end of
  the current statement instead of doing nothing.

NF-42-F329-003 Fix of "use clause would make operation legal" (2007-04-20)

  Compiler messages "use clause would make operation legal" are now
  automatically fixed by GPS, by adding the missing use clause to the file.

NF-42-F223-023 Retrieve 'Class attribute on tooltip documentation (2007-05-02)

  Documentation displayed by tooltips now displays type of parameters and
  variables with 'Class when relevant.

NF-42-D914-005 Better feedback when build fails w/o src location (2007-04-19)

  When a build fails with no file:line location (e.g. error at link time),
  GPS now raises the Messages window to make the error more visible.

NF-42-C127-006 Ability to use shell syntax on custom build/run (2007-04-11)

  When using the Build>Run>Custom and Build>Make>Custom menus, it is now
  possible to use shell syntax, as recognized by the SHELL environment
  variable, if set.
