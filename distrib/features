New features in GPS 5.1.0 / GNATbench 2.6.0
-------------------------------------------

NF-51-K216-038 GB: new Insert Unit Comment Box action (2011-02-16)

  A new command for inserting a comment box containing the unit
  name has been added.  Subprograms, entries, packages, and
  protected objects are supported. This command works exactly
  like the "Insert Subprogram Box" command in GPS.

NF-51-K215-022 New menu Tools->View->Messages (2011-02-16)

  This menu brings up the Messages View.

NF-51-K209-048 New plugin to prevent project edition (2011-02-15)

  A new plugin "prevent_project_edition.py", inactive by default,
  prevents graphical edition of projects from GPS. This is useful in
  contexts where the project files are hand-written and their formatting
  should be preserved.

NF-51-K202-008 Improved indentation of Ada 2012 constructs (2011-02-03)

  Ada 2012 Expression functions and aspects are now better recognized and
  indented by the internal Ada parser.

NF-51-K113-012 GPS: improvements in createfile.py plug-in (2011-01-13)

  The dialog provided by this plug-in has been improved and the file created
  now appears automatically in the project view.

NF-51-JC10-012 GPS: "short titles" pref applies to docked windows (2010-12-13)

  This preference used to only have an effect on floating windows, but will
  now also force docked windows to use short titles (in particular base names
  for file editors).

NF-51-JB30-015 GPS: new zap-to-char and just-one-space actions (2010-12-01)

  These actions complete the Emacs emulation in GPS, and have the same
  behavior as in Emacs. See the Key Shortcuts menu for more information.

NF-51-JB26-007 GB: Improve spell checking feature in ada editor (2010-12-16)

  Under Eclipse, the spell checking now only considers comments and string
  literals. String literals spell checking can be disabled using the check box
  "Ignore string literals when spell checking" accessible from menu Window =>
  Preferences => Ada => Editor.

NF-51-JB23-022 GB: Add tooltips in ada editor (2010-12-08)

  GNATbench now displays tooltips for entities in the editor, showing their
  profile and documentation. They can be disabled from the menu Window =>
  Preferences => Ada => Editor.

NF-51-JB18-031 GPS: New API to retrieve multiple files in contexts (2010-12-10)

  A new Python/Shell API (FileContext.files) allows retrieving as a list all
  files stored in a context. This is useful in particular when working with
  the VCS Explorer.

NF-51-JB16-016 GPS: New facility for handling VCS menus (2010-12-10)

  GPS provides a facility for handling all VCS menus in a centralized place,
  allowing customization of the layout of all VCS menus, both for systems
  that are supported out-of-the-box in GPS, and for custom VCS.

NF-51-JB05-015 GB: Add some jdt-equivalent key shortcuts (2010-11-05)

  Some shortcuts defined in JDT or CDT for toggling comments have been added
  to gnatbench (Ctrl+Shift+C and Ctrl+7).

NF-51-JA25-016 GPS: ispell module stops at underscores (2010-11-05)

  When looking for the word to spell check, the ispell.py module will now
  stop at '_' characters, thus allowing you to fix mispelling in words like
  'lookng_for'

NF-51-J805-009 Based literals not auto cased (2010-10-17)

  Auto-casing now keeps based literals with their original casing rather than
  applying automatic casing as done for e.g. identifiers.

NF-51-J725-004 Add support for sorting on rectangle selections (2011-01-12)

  It is now possible to sort on rectangular selections. The column range
  on the rectangular selection is used to get the key on each line on which
  lines are sorted. Sorting in both ascending and descending order are
  supported.

NF-51-I618-021 GPS: Add support for sorting the process list (2011-02-16)

  The process list can now be sorted based on the pid or the command. This
  makes it easier to find a specific process in the list. At the same time,
  the process list now contains only the actual command for better
  readability.

NF-51-I128-011 GPS: save CodePeer filter settings between sessions (2011-02-17)

  GPS saves CodePeer Summary Report's filter settings between sessions.

NF-51-GA03-018 GPS: Project View uses a case-insensitive sort (2010-10-17)

  Entries (project, package, subprogram, types names) in the Project
  View are now sorted ignoring the casing, which is in general more user
  friendly.

NF-51-G823-005 GPS: Leave codefix wrench for readonly files (2010-10-26)

  When an auto fix is applied on a readonly file, the wrench icon does not
  disappear and an error message is added in the Messages window.
