New features in GPS 4.1.0
-------------------------

F727-011 Fix "two consecutive underlines not permitted" (2006-07-27)

  GPS will provide auto fixes for "two consecutive underlines not permitted"
  message, by removing extra underlines.

F721-007 New incremental search module (2006-07-25)

  On platforms where python is available, a new module is provided to
  emulate Emacs' incremental search feature in editors

F720-008 Improved Emacs emulation (2006-07-21)

  Several new key bindings were defined to emulate Emacs. The handling of
  selections (mark+cursor) was also enhanced

F719-012 Removed support for old customization directories

  in GPS 2.x, the following directories were searched for customization
  files: ~/.gps/customize, ~/.gps/python_startup, $prefix/share/gps/customize
  and the file $prefix/share/gps/python/autoexec.py.
  GPS 3.x was no longer creating these directories, although still reading
  them if it found scripts in there. GPS now ignores these directories.
  Use $prefix/share/gps/plug-ins and ~/.gps/plug-ins instead

F704-013 Fix "end loop Name; expected" (2006-07-27)

  It's now possible to fix automatically messages like "end loop Name; 
  expected".

EA14-021 Fix "use 'Valid attribute instead" (2006-07-28)

  It's now possible to fix automatically messages like "use 'Valid instead", 
  in e.g. "A in B" (won't work with "not in").
