New features in GPS 5.1.0 / GNATbench 2.6.0
-------------------------------------------

NF-51-JB30-015 GPS: new zap-to-char and just-one-space actions (2010-12-01)

  These actions complete the Emacs emulation in GPS, and have the same
  behavior as in Emacs. See the Key Shortcuts menu for more information.

NF-51-JB23-022 GB: Add tooltips in ada editor (2010-12-08)

  GNATbench now displays tooltips for entities in the editor, showing their
  profile and documentation. They can be disabled from the menu Window =>
  Preferences => Ada => Editor.

NF-51-JB16-016 GPS: New facility for handling VCS menus (2010-12-10)

  GPS provides a facility for handling all VCS menus in a centralized place,
  allowing customization of the layout of all VCS menus, both for systems
  that are supported out-of-the-box in GPS, and for custom VCS.

NF-51-JB05-015 GB: Add some jdt-equivalent key shortcuts (2010-11-05)

  Some shortcuts defined in JDT or CDT for toggling comments have been added
  to gnatbench (Ctrl+Shift+C and Ctrl+7).

NF-51-JA25-016 GPS: ispell module stops at underscores (2010-11-05)

  When looking for the word to spell check, the ispell.py module will now
  stop at '_' characters, thus allowing you to fix mispelling in words like
  'lookng_for'

NF-51-J805-009 Based literals not auto cased (2010-10-17)

  Auto-casing now keeps based literals with their original casing rather than
  applying automatic casing as done for e.g. identifiers.

NF-51-GA03-018 GPS: Project View uses a case-insensitive sort (2010-10-17)

  Entries (project, package, subprogram, types names) in the Project
  View are now sorted ignoring the casing, which is in general more user
  friendly.

NF-51-G823-005 GPS: Leave codefix wrench for readonly files (2010-10-26)

  When an auto fix is applied on a readonly file, the wrench icon does not
  disappear and an error message is added in the Messages window.
