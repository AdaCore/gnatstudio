New features in 5.1.0
---------------------

NF-51-J805-009 Based literals not auto cased (2010-10-17)

  GPS now keeps based literals with their original casing rather than
  applying automatic casing as done for e.g. identifiers.

NF-51-J119-018 Use all available space to display routine names (2010-10-16)

  The GPS editor does not cut the routine name at 20 characters but uses
  all available spaces in the editor's status line.

NF-51-GA03-018 Project Explorer uses a non case-sensitive sort (2010-10-17)

  Entries (project, package, subprogram, types names) in the Project
  Explorer are now sorted using a non case-sensitive sort. This is more
  user friendly.
