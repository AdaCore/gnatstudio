New features in GPS 5.3.0 / GNATbench 2.8.0
-------------------------------------------

NF-53-M109-036 GPS: autofix on missing constant with preferences (2013-01-21)

  Autofix has always done fixes in lowercases. This enhancement performs
  the fixes on missing constants following the user defined preferences
  specified in Preferences/Editor/Ada/Reserved word casing

NF-53-M102-006 GPS: move Serialize to /Edit/Rectangle/ (2013-01-11)

  This menu was previously in /Edit/Selection, but is more logical in the
  Rectangle submenu since it conceptually applies to a rectangle.

NF-53-LB20-022 GPS: Key shortcuts dialog display improved (2012-11-21)

  The display of the key shortcuts in this dialog now matches what is
  done for the toplevel menus, using symbols like up arrow for the shift
  key, a caret sign for the control key, and the special symbols for
  Mac keyboards.

NF-53-LB15-037 GPS: EditorOverlay can now highlight a whole line (2012-12-05)

  The EditorOverlay class can now be used in Python plugins to highlight an
  entire line, through the property "paragraph-background":
    # Create an overlay for an editor:
    b = GPS.EditorBuffer.get(GPS.File ("my_file.adb"))
    o = b.create_overlay("my_overlay_name")

    # Set the paragraph-background property to pink
    o.set_property ("paragraph-background", "#f0c0c0")

    # This highlights the entire line 317 in my file
    b.apply_overlay (o,
       GPS.EditorLocation(b, 317, 1),
       GPS.EditorLocation(b, 317, 1))

NF-53-LB04-004 GB: Export GNATbench preferences like CDT (2013-01-22)

  GNATbench preferences can now be exported via the export preferences wizard
  and imported into another workspace via the import preferences wizard.

NF-53-L926-027 GPS: Project, Files and Windows views pop-ups (2012-11-13)

  Tooltips added to views to help navigation when windows are narrow.

NF-53-L921-032 GPS: Show protected objects in Outline view (2012-10-16)

  Protected and task types/objects and their entries are now visible in
  Outline View. New filter in Outline View "Show tasks, entries, and protected
  types" is used to show/hide these items.

NF-53-J728-022 GPS: the Project Wizard takes advantage of gnatname (2012-11-08)

  The project wizard now optionally uses gnatname to search for Ada units in
  files with non-standard naming conventions.
