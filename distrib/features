New features in GPS 4.1.0
-------------------------

F801-019 Project with links hides files in the project explorer (2006-08-08)

  When a project's source dirs are in fact symbolic links, and if you have
  forgotten to unselect the preference Fast Project Loading, the project
  explorer will now show the source files anyway, but the directory names
  have been changed to the directory pointed to by the symbolic links.

F731-001 Alias expansion containing percent sign (2006-07-31)

  It is now possible to use a percent sign as part of an alias expansion,
  by using the special string %%.

F727-011 Fix "two consecutive underlines not permitted" (2006-07-27)

  GPS will provide auto fixes for "two consecutive underlines not permitted"
  message, by removing extra underlines.

F721-007 New incremental search module (2006-07-25)

  On platforms where python is available, a new module is provided to
  emulate Emacs' incremental search feature in editors

F720-008 Improved Emacs emulation (2006-07-21)

  Several new key bindings were defined to emulate Emacs. The handling of
  selections (mark+cursor) was also enhanced

F719-012 New dialog /Edit/Startup Script Editor

  This new dialog allows you to chose which scripts GPS should load on
  startup. We have also made more scripts optionally loadable through this
  dialog, when you previously had to copy them manually from the examples
  directory.

F719-012 Removed support for old customization directories

  in GPS 2.x, the following directories were searched for customization
  files: ~/.gps/customize, ~/.gps/python_startup, $prefix/share/gps/customize
  and the file $prefix/share/gps/python/autoexec.py.
  GPS 3.x was no longer creating these directories, although still reading
  them if it found scripts in there. GPS now ignores these directories.
  Use $prefix/share/gps/plug-ins and ~/.gps/plug-ins instead

F704-013 Fix "end loop Name; expected" (2006-07-27)

  It's now possible to fix automatically messages like "end loop Name; 
  expected".

EA14-021 Fix "use 'Valid attribute instead" (2006-07-28)

  It's now possible to fix automatically messages like "use 'Valid instead", 
  in e.g. "A in B" (won't work with "not in").
