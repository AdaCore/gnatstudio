New features in GPS 5.1.0 / GNATbench 2.6.0
-------------------------------------------

NF-51-K909-038 GPS: select object dir when creating extended prj (2011-09-09)

  The wizard used to create extending projects now allows you to chose the
  location of the object directory, where the compiler will put the result
  of the compilation.

NF-51-K905-010 GPS: new gnatmetric.py plugin (2011-09-07)

  The gnatmetrics plugin has been rewritten. This new version allows to compute
  metrics for a project and its subprojects, and it is possible to choose the
  options to pass to gnatmetric before launching it.

NF-51-K902-022 GPS: new attributes in custom VCS (2011-09-12)

  New attributes "prev_revision" and "head_revision" can be specified when
  defining custom VCS. These attributes are used as defaults when comparing
  between two revisions.

NF-51-K830-011 GPS: remove files from extending projects (2011-09-09)

  A new contextual menu is now available when a file belongs to an extending
  project. The file can be deleted and removed from that project (and thus the
  project will see the version of the file from its extended project).

NF-51-K817-010 GPS: choose dir when adding file to extending prj (2011-09-09)

  When you select the menu "Add to extending project" for a file, the dialog
  that proposes to copy the file will now let you chose among the source
  directories of the extending project.

NF-51-K809-019 GPS: save files automatically on run of SPARK tools (2011-08-12)

  GPS saves modified files automatically when SPARK tools are run and
  the "Auto Save" preference is enabled.

NF-51-K722-014 GPS: project editor saves past attribute values (2011-07-25)

  The project properties editor will now save previous values of some of
  the attributes (for instance the Source List File). That way, if you disable
  an attribute and later on decide that it should be re-enabled, the previous
  value is easily reset without browsing for the file again.

NF-51-K705-014 GPS: methods.py plugin now shows inherited methods (2011-07-05)

  The methods.py plugin adds a contextual menu References/Methods when you
  click on a tagged type. This menu will now also show inherited methods.

NF-51-K628-037 Extend quick fix support for 'Valid (2011-07-01)

  The automatic code fixing capability has been enhanced to handle
  the replacement of "not in" by 'Valid. For example, the expression
  "X not in T'Range" is replaced by "not X'Valid".

NF-51-K519-038 GB: Add GNATbench debug trace feature (2011-08-25)

  For GNATbench debug purpose, a user configurable debug trace is added. when
  enabled the log can be printed to a console and/or a file. The feature is
  configurable through Ada preferences pages.

NF-51-K518-001 GPS: Improve creation of new files (2011-05-20)

  GPS now proposes to store new files in a more user friendly way. The
  default directory to create the file depends on the context. So for
  example if a specific directory is selected into the project explorer
  the File->New action will record this location. This specific location
  will then be proposed by default when doing File->Save.

NF-51-K517-014 GB: Add debug tooltip displaying current value (2011-08-29)

  Under Eclipse Helios (3.6) or later, GNATbench Integration with CDT Ada
  Editor tooltip feature displays current value instead of documentation when
  hovering over an expression in the Ada Editor during a debug session.
  Note: The debug session must be launched using an Ada GDB (DSF) Process
  Launcher. (see GNATbench debugging documentation)

NF-51-K430-002 GPS: Improve support on refilling comments (2011-05-08)

  Edit->Selection->Refill has been improved to search for comments in the
  selected lines and refill them using an algorithm that, after refilling
  the contents of the comment, compares adjacent lines and decides whether
  a word should be moved to the next line to make the lines more even.

NF-51-K428-011 GPS: Reduce needs for status update in VCS (2011-05-28)

  GPS now takes advantage of Subversion commit output to update the
  file statuses. This avoids the need of running a query status after
  a commit action. This is motivated by the fact that Subversion status
  may be really slow across network.

NF-51-K422-015 GPS: General GUI cleanup (2011-05-12)

  Many graphical elements of the GPS interface have been refreshed. In
  particular:
    - The close buttons in the title bars have been changed, and tabs now
      contain a close button.
    - The Search view has been also modified to present search options in a
      clearer and nicer way.
    - The browsers have been refreshed, with some added capabilities such as
      the capability to export to PDF, and a more complete export to SVG.
    - The different Combo boxes used in GPS have been reviewed, and their
      appearance now correctly reflects whether they can be edited or not.

NF-51-K421-021 GPS: Support for highlighting "info" messages (2011-07-04)

  The messages sent by the compiler as "info" messages are now highlighted
  with a different color, which is customizable through the "Messages" section

  replacement of horizontal tabs by spaces. Each tab is replaced by the
  spaces required to preserve the columns of the sources.

NF-51-K406-021 GPS: Support for more assembly languages (2011-04-06)

  GPS now supports languages "Asm_Cpp" (file extension .S by default) and
  "Asm2" (.asm) to be in line with the languages recognized by gprbuild.
  The language "Asm" (.s files) was already supported in GPS 5.0.

NF-51-K404-031 Quick fix support for 'First .. 'Last (2011-07-01)

  The automatic code fixing capability has been enhanced to replace
  occurrences of T'first .. T'last by T'Valid.

  As part of the optional debugger.py plug-in, a new menu is provided when
  debugging which allows displaying of a variable by its fully expanded
  name (e.g. Ada.Text_IO.Status_Error vs Status_Error) to make it easier
  in some cases to print contents of a variable.

NF-51-K224-003 Add support for Ada 2012 in the project editor (2011-02-28)

  Add support for the -gnat12 switch in the project editor.

NF-51-K209-048 GPS: New plugin to prevent project edition (2011-02-15)

  A new plugin "prevent_project_edition.py", inactive by default,
  prevents graphical edition of projects from GPS. This is useful in
  contexts where the project files are hand-written and their formatting
  should be preserved.

NF-51-K204-022 Use project's gnatls for default project path (2011-03-02)

  The IDEs will now check the project's IDE.Gnatlist attribute to query the
  default project path (instead of always running the native "gnatls").
  This allows a project to depend on a project only available for cross
  platforms (for instance "zfp_support.gpr").
