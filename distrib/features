New features in GPS 4.1.0
-------------------------

F912-027 Allow any character in scenario variable names (2006-09-16)

  The list of valid character for names of scenario variables is no longer
  limited to alphanumeric characters. In particular on VMS, it is standard to
  use names like GNAT$PLATFORM

F912-002 The File Selection dialog uses the current context (2006-09-14)

  When opening the File Selection dialog while an editor is selected, the
  dialog starts at the directory in which the file is located.

F907-003 Remember the last search context for file searching (2006-09-13)

  Doing a search from an editor opens the search view with the 'Look in field'
  set to the last editor-related used context ("Current_File",
  "Files from project", "Files..." or "Open Files"), not only to "Current_File"
  as it used to do.

F906-007 Project wizard and properties check for empty object dir (2006-09-16)

  A new XML attribute allow_empty can be used when describing project
  attributes. In particular, it is now used to make sure that the user doesn't
  set the object or exec directories to an empty string, which isn't supported
  by tools and results in an error when parsing the project file.

F822-013 Disable the "replace all" confirmation with a preference (2006-09-12)

  A new preference has been added, in the search pannel of the GPS preferences,
  'Confirmation for "Replace all"'. By default, this preference is enabled, and
  pressing "Replace all" from the search window displays a confirmation dialog.
  It's possible to disable this either by unchecking the checkbox in the
  preferences panel, or by directly checking the checkbox "Do not ask again"
  in the popup.

F810-009 Entity browser speed up (2006-08-11)

  The cross-reference engine has been improved so that getting the children of
  a tagged type in the entity browser is now much faster.

F801-019 Project with links hides files in the project explorer (2006-08-08)

  When a project's source dirs are in fact symbolic links, and if you have
  forgotten to unselect the preference Fast Project Loading, the project
  explorer will now show the source files anyway, but the directory names
  have been changed to the directory pointed to by the symbolic links.

F731-001 Alias expansion containing percent sign (2006-07-31)

  It is now possible to use a percent sign as part of an alias expansion,
  by using the special string %%.

F727-011 Fix "two consecutive underlines not permitted" (2006-07-27)

  GPS will provide auto fixes for "two consecutive underlines not permitted"
  message, by removing extra underlines.

F721-007 New incremental search module (2006-07-25)

  On platforms where python is available, a new module is provided to
  emulate Emacs' incremental search feature in editors

F720-008 Improved Emacs emulation (2006-07-21)

  Several new key bindings were defined to emulate Emacs. The handling of
  selections (mark+cursor) was also enhanced

F719-014 Improved support for "no title bar" (2006-08-21)

  When disabling the "Show title bars" preference, GPS now displays the
  full name of the current editor in the main title bar, to ease working
  in this mode, and differenciate files with the same base name.

F719-012 New dialog /Edit/Startup Script Editor (2006-08-04)

  This new dialog allows you to chose which scripts GPS should load on
  startup. We have also made more scripts optionally loadable through this
  dialog, when you previously had to copy them manually from the examples
  directory.

F719-012 Removed support for old customization directories (2006-08-04)

  in GPS 2.x, the following directories were searched for customization
  files: ~/.gps/customize, ~/.gps/python_startup, $prefix/share/gps/customize
  and the file $prefix/share/gps/python/autoexec.py.
  GPS 3.x was no longer creating these directories, although still reading
  them if it found scripts in there. GPS now ignores these directories.
  Use $prefix/share/gps/plug-ins and ~/.gps/plug-ins instead

F704-013 Fix "end loop Name; expected" (2006-07-27)

  It's now possible to fix automatically messages like "end loop Name;
  expected".

EA14-021 Fix "use 'Valid attribute instead" (2006-07-28)

  It's now possible to fix automatically messages like "use 'Valid instead",
  in e.g. "A in B" (won't work with "not in").
