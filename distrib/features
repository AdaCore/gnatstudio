New features in GPS 5.2.0 / GNATbench 2.7.0
-------------------------------------------

NF-52-L822-044 GB: additional Pretty Printer output flexibility (2012-08-22)

  The "Pretty Print" command now allows any output file settings, rather than
  unconditionally forcing a specific behavior.  The current default behavior is
  unchanged, in that the input file is replaced with the formatted output, but
  this is now under the control of a new preference.  If the preference is
  disabled, the behavior regarding the output file is controlled by the
  Pretty_Printer package in the project file. If that package is not defined in
  the project file or output switches are not specified, the behavior is
  the default specified by the pretty printer tool itself.

NF-52-L814-023 GB: add User's Guides PDF versions  (2012-08-14)

  The PDF versions (A4 or letter) can be downloaded from a top level PDF
  versions page located in the GNATbench help contents.

NF-52-L730-016 GPS: display timestamps in File Selector dialog (2012-08-02)

  The dialog from /File/Open... now displays the timestamp for local files.

NF-52-L726-020 GPS: search in current project only (2012-08-16)

  New scope to search in the currently selected project.

NF-52-L723-018 ECL: gprbuild use of cross compilers via makefiles (2012-07-23)

  GNATbench for Eclipse now directly supports use of makefiles and gprbuild to
  invoke cross-compilers.  The --target switch is passed to the makefile when
  invoked.

NF-52-L718-050 GB: Allow all Ada versions in new-project wizard  (2012-07-18)

  When using the new-project wizard to create GNATbech projects, the user can
  choose among the Ada 95, 2005, and 2012 revisions of the language.

NF-52-L716-044 ECL: makefiles can now use gprbuild (2012-07-16)

  When GNATbench for Eclipse project builds are driven by makefiles, the
  builder name is passed as a macro.  In the past this builder name was
  always passed as "gnatmake" but it can now also be "gprbuild" instead.

NF-52-L703-018 GB: GNAT & Ada reference manuals in GNATbench help (2012-08-02)

  Add to GNATbench help content
  - GNAT user guide & reference manual
  - Ada language reference manuals
  - GPRbuild user guide

NF-52-L703-004 GB: Eclipse Juno (3.8) support (2012-07-10)

  Eclipse 3.8 is supported by GNATbench 2.7.0
  Note: Eclipse 3.8 requires a JRE 1.6 (Java Runtime Environment).

NF-52-L702-019 GPS: Clear locations action for key shortcuts (2012-07-04)

  GPS provides a new action to assign a key shortcut to the 'Clear locations'
  capability of the Locations View.

NF-52-L614-009 GPS: Removal of ClearCase module preference (2012-06-21)

  This preference gave access to an old version of ClearCase support, replaced
  by ClearCase Native support since several versions. This preference is now
  removed and all ClearCase users are invited to switch to ClearCase Native
  instead, if not already done.

NF-52-L608-027 ECL: Scenario variables are passed to makefiles (2012-06-08)

  Now when building or compiling using makefiles, the scenario variables (if
  any) are passed to the makefile invocation so that the makefile can reference
  them if need be.

NF-52-L521-019 GPS: Minimal scrolling when jumping to a location (2012-05-21)

  The scrolling that occurs when going to an editor location is slightly
  less intrusive, scrolling minimally to reveal the location plus a bit of
  margin rather than centering on the location.

NF-52-L514-028 GPS: Action tooltip in Locations view (2012-05-21)

  The Locations View now displays a tooltip for the action associated with a
  message.

NF-52-L503-002 GPS: improved support for C++ mangled names (2012-08-24)

  GPS incorporates support to handle directly C++ mangled names. This improves
  its response time navigating from Ada to C++ sources and removes the
  dependency of GPS on the external tool c++filt. This new support requires
  a version of the G++ compiler from the GNAT toolset later than 2012-06-23.

NF-52-L426-037 GB: remove trailing blanks when saving an ada file (2012-08-14)

  When saving ada files, trailing blanks can be removed. This is done via the
  new "Remove trailing spaces when saving" preference found in the Ada
  "Editor" page.
  The different capabilities are "Never", "Autodetect" and "Always".
  Autodetect means that removing trailing blanks occurs only if the file had
  already saved trailing blanks.

NF-52-L416-043 GB: Improved search results interaction (2012-04-16)

  When a non-nested entry is selected in the search results, the editor is now
  opened on the first enclosed match rather than on the enclosing construct
  itself.  For example, if one or more references occur to the intended entity
  within a subprogram, the subprogram name is the entry in the results, rather
  than each enclosed match being given a distinct entry. Selecting the entry
  for the subprogram will no longer open the editor on the subprogram name in
  the declaration. It will open the editor at the first enclosed reference.

NF-52-L416-019 GPS: improve batch codefix support (2012-05-03)

  GPS now provides the ability to fix automatically similar errors in batch
  mode when multiple choices available.

NF-52-L405-002 GPS: experimental Mercurial plugin (2012-07-17)

  GPS now has an experimental support for the Mercurial VCS.

NF-52-L329-026 GPS: Improved emacs selection mode support (2012-03-30)

  When using the emacs mode, after setting a mark, the commands to go to the
  beginning and end of line will extend the selection.

NF-52-L329-021 GPS: isearch.py stores result of ctrl+w in history (2012-03-29)

  When you start a search (ctrl+s) and then use ctrl+w to copy parts of the
  current identifier as the search pattern, this pattern is now stored
  immediately in the history. That way, cancelling the search and restarting
  it with ctrl+s ctrl+s will search what was copied (we used to update the
  pattern only after you pressed ctrl+s a second time after ctrl+w).
  This is closer to Emacs' behavior.

NF-52-L327-003 GPS: displaying metrics in GPS (2012-05-17)

  The GPS is able to reopen the Metrics view from the Tools->View->Metrics
  menu.

NF-52-L320-004 GPS: simplify Default Builder preference (2012-03-20)

  The Default Builder preference has been simplified, with the following
  changes:
    - 'Gprmake' setting removed, since gprmake is no longer supported;
    - 'Gprbuild' setting renamed 'Auto', more accurate;
    - 'Gprbuild_Always' setting renamed 'Gprbuild', for consistency with the
      'Gnatmake' setting.

  Note that if you were using a non default setting for this preference, you
  will need to reset it manually.

NF-52-L227-030 GB: project names need not be legal Ada identifiers (2012-03-09)

  The name of an Eclipse/Workbench project need not conform to the rules for
  Ada identifiers.  This change applies to both new projects and as well as
  existing Eclipse/Workbench projects to be converted to GNATbench use.

NF-52-L213-028 GPS: new command GPS.EditorLocation.inside_word (2012-02-13)

  A new Shell/Python command allows determining whether a location is inside a
  word. This is useful when creating editor plugins.

NF-52-L211-002 GPS: wildcard support in Open From Project (2012-04-09)

  Wildcard characters are now taken into account in the "Open From Project..."
  dialog.

NF-52-L124-025 GPS: improvements in auto_highlight_occurrences.py (2012-02-16)

  The plugin auto_highlight_occurrences.py has two new features:
    - if there is a selection, the other occurrences of the selected text
      will be highlighted in the editor
    - if the cursor is on a word which is not a navigable entity (for instance
      keywords, words in comments, or in languages other than Ada or C), GPS
      will perform a text-based highlighting of this word

  Both of these behaviors can be deactivated through the Preferences dialog,
  section Plugins->auto_highlight_occurrences.

NF-52-L120-062 GB: set actual name of main in debug config (2012-05-16)

  Newly created debug configurations now set the default breakpoint to the
  procedure of the main executable rather than simply "main".

NF-52-L118-005 ECL: Removal policy when fixing code (2012-01-24)

    A "Removal policy when fixing code" preference setting is added to Ada
    "General" preference page. It defines the way to fix code when parts have
    to be removed.
    - `Always_Remove` means that the code will be removed by GNATbench.
    - `Always_Comment` means that the code will always be commented out.
    - `Propose_Both_Choices` will propose a menu with both choices.

NF-52-L109-019 GPS: goto next/previous bookmark (2012-01-23)

  Two new actions ("Goto Next Bookmark" and "Goto Previous Bookmark") are
  available to jump to nearest bookmarks in current file.
  They can be bound to keys in the "General" section of the Key Shortcuts
  dialog.

NF-52-L109-016 GPS: New action "Delete Line" (2012-01-11)

  This action deletes the current line and places the cursor on the beginning
  of the following line.
  It can be bound to a key in the "Editor" section of the Key Shortcuts dialog.

NF-52-L101-003 GB: display task info in debug view (2012-01-10)

  Ada task information is now displayed in the debug view.  This feature can
  be enabled/disabled from the debug view menu.

  looking output. In particular, the new format provides an integrated
  search feature over all pages of the manual.

NF-52-KB30-016 ECL: improve builder support (2012-08-08)

  Commands used when compiling/building/cleaning projects or files can be
  customized editing the builder targets. (see Ada "Builder Targets"
  preference page).
  builder toobar buttons can be added enabling "GNATbench Build Toolbar Menus"
  command group when customizing Ada perspective.
  A build mode chooser (checks/debug/default/gcov/gprof/optimize) is also
  available in the "GNATbench Build Toolbar Menus"

NF-52-KB10-053 GB: outside workspace relative path support (2011-12-06)

  Relative path for GNAT project file in the GNATbench properties can point to
  a file located outside the workspace.

NF-52-KA28-027 GPS: new Editor action "toggle wrapping" (2011-10-28)

  A new action "toggle wrapping" is defined in the plugin text_utils.py,
  and can be associated to a key binding in the Key Shortcuts editor to
  conveniently switch between no wrapping and word wrapping in the current
  editor.

NF-52-KA27-013 GPS: improved smart completion on C/C++ (2012-05-20)

  GPS incorporates support to analyze the context and provide better
  proposals for smart completion of C/C++ entities, including cases
  like: x.field, x->field, x.method, x->method, x[...][...]->field,
  x[...][...]->method, and class::method.

  GPS also proposes smart completion of parameters in function and method
  calls. The name of the formals is added as C comments to facilitate adding
  the actuals. For example: "obj.copy (/* target */  , /* source */  )"

NF-52-KA03-005 GPS: force use of gprbuild (2011-12-06)

  It is now possible to always use gprbuild as a builder for projects,
  whether these projects are multi-language or not. This is done via the
  new preference 'Default builder', using the 'Gprbuild_Always' setting.

NF-52-K223-024 ECL: support for gprbuild (2012-08-07)

  GNATbench for Eclipse now directly supports use of gprbuild, in addition
  to gnatmake, when building.  Selection of the builder is via the Ada
  "General" preferences.  The preferences are to 1) always use gprbuild,
  2) always use gnatmake, or 3) to automatically select the builder on a
  per-project basis.  Automatic selection is based upon whether multiple
  languages are specified in the project gpr file.
