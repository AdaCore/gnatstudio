New features in GPS 4.3.0
-------------------------

NF-43-GB14-004 New VCS action to prepare group commit in one click (2007-11-17)

  The new VCS action "Commit as new Activity" has been implemented to simplify
  simple group-commit activity. Calling this action will create an anonymous
  activity, populate it with all selected files from the VCS Explorer and
  open the activity log file. Just fill it and commit the activity.

NF-43-GB07-006 Major speed up in project view (2007-11-26)

  The computation time for the project view was greatly improved, and the
  view displays much faster now on big projects.
