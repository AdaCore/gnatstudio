New features in 5.1.0
---------------------

NF-51-J805-009 Based literals not auto cased (2010-10-17)

  GPS now keeps based literals with their original casing rather than
  applying automatic casing as done for e.g. identifiers.

NF-51-GA03-018 Project View uses a case-insensitive sort (2010-10-17)

  Entries (project, package, subprogram, types names) in the Project
  View are now sorted ignoring the casing, which is in general more user
  friendly.

NF-51-G823-005 Leave codefix wrench for readonly files (2010-10-26)

  When a auto fix is applied on a readonly file, the fix wrench is left and
  an error message is added in the message window.
