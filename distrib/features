New features on 4.4.0
---------------------

NF-44-I909-020 Reload project after POGS (2009-09-10)

   The project is recomputed after POGS to refresh the project view and take
   into account possible new directories.

NF-44-I909-011 Open siv file after running the Simplifier (2009-09-10)

   GPS opens the updated/generated siv file after running the Simplifier.

NF-44-I908-023 Support for specifying POGS options in project (2009-09-10)

   Added support in "Edit Project Properties -> POGS" for user to specify
   an input directory and an output file.

NF-44-I907-012 Open SPARK Output window after "Simplify All" (2009-09-10)

   GPS now raises the SPARK Output window after the user selects
   "Simplify All".

NF-44-I904-005 Added "Simplify All" to SPARK contextual menu (2009-09-10)

   A new "Simplify All" item is available in the SPARK contextual menu.

NF-44-I807-021 New plug-in: createfile.py (2009-08-10)

   This optional plug-in provides a contextual menu that allows you to create
   new files in the selected directory, rather than use /File/New and then
   navigate to the directory in which the file should be saved.

NF-44-I729-038 Support for e500v2-wrs-vxworks toolchain (2009-07-30)

   The project properties editor now offers the e500v2-wrs-vxworks toolchain
   as a predefined choice of compiler and debugger tools.

NF-44-I721-010 Support for -language examiner switch (2009-07-21)

   GPS now supports the new SPARK Examiner switch -language which also
   replaces the -ada83 switch.

NF-44-I717-022 Improved construct database reload (2009-08-18)

   Completion database reload is now much faster, only taking care of the
   files added/removed, instead of recomputing the whole database. This
   is visible when e.g. reloading a project, changing the scenario values,
   adding or removing a file.

NF-44-I717-007 Tip of the Day dialog (2009-07-17)

   GPS now displays a "Tip of the Day" dialog at startup. This is activated
   by default. To deactivate it, simply uncheck the box at the bottom and
   close it. To re-activate it, enable the preference "Tip of the Day" in the
   General section of the preferences.

NF-44-I713-007 Improved mouse selection in editor (2009-07-18)

   It is now possible to hold the mouse button after a double-click to extend
   the selection word by word.

NF-44-I702-018 New plug-in: "eclipse.py" with "delete line" action (2009-07-02)

   GPS now contains an "eclipse.py" plugin, disabled by default, which
   defines an action "delete line" (bound to ctrl-d) to delete the lines
   that include the selection. More actions and key bindings will be added
   later in this plug-in to ease mixed usage of Eclipse and GPS.

NF-44-I630-005 Improved error detection in Builder plugins (2009-06-30)

   When writing Python plugins to add support for Build targets (such as the
   Makefile.py plugin), GPS now detects malformed targets sets and displays a
   message instead of failing silently.

NF-44-I616-052 New action to toggle auto-casing on/off (2009-06-24)

   GPS provides a new action called "Toggle Auto Casing/indentation" which
   toggles the auto-casing. When using On-The-Fly casing it is more convenient
   to use this sticky action (via its associated key shortcut, alt-q by
   default) instead of the action which disables casing for a single character
   only.

NF-44-I616-051 On-The-Fly casing is conservative (2009-07-06)

   GPS On-The-Fly casing mode is now more conservative and will do the
   casing based on the actual characters typed by the user instead of
   the current buffer content when possible.

NF-44-I610-012 Outline view hierarchy (2009-07-02)

   The outline now represents a hierarchical view of the contents of the file,
   as opposed to a flat view. Global variables and field information have been
   added. In addition, the "Dynamic link with editor" feature and the tooltips
   are now synchronized with the contents of the source file without having
   to compile sources anymore.

NF-44-I602-021 New plugin: open_file.py (2009-06-03)

   This plugin creates a contextual menu. If you click on the name of a file
   in an editor, the new menu gives you the choice of automatically searching
   and opening this file in a new editor.

NF-44-I602-018 Display completion proposal in Completion Window (2009-06-11)

   The auxiliary window in the Smart Completion now shows the full name of
   the completion proposal. This helps when the completion proposal is too
   long to be displayed entirely in the list window.

NF-44-I602-003 New preference: Wrap around on next/previous (2009-04-06)

   When using the 'Next Tag' and 'Previous Tag' actions/menus, this
   preference determines whether wrap around to the beginning should occur
   when reaching the end of the category.

NF-44-I529-007 Browsing output directory for SPARK Examiner (2009-09-10)

   Users can now browse SPARK Examiner output directories via
   Project Properties -> Switches -> Examiner -> Output Directory

NF-44-I528-009 Debug->Add Symbols asks for module's address (2009-06-14)

   The Debug->Debug->Add Symbols... menu now also asks for the module's
   address to be given to gdb.

NF-44-I513-024 Permanent GPS.EditorMark (2009-05-19)

   Marks created through the GPS.EditorMark python API will now stay
   valid even if the editor is closed, and possibly reopen.

NF-44-I427-035 Smart completion: backspace key re-expands list (2009-05-05)

   When entering text while the smart completion window is up, the smart
   completion window narrows the list of choices to match the text. When there
   are no more choices, the completion window disappears completely.
   Now, pressing backspace to erase the last characters will cause the
   completion window to reappear.

NF-44-I425-006 VCS actions supported from auxiliary buffers (2009-04-29)

   VCS actions can now be run from auxiliary buffers (e.g. diff windows).

NF-44-I424-009 Editing unsupported projects (2009-06-01)

   When a project contains statements that make it uneditable graphically
   ("Var := ..."), you are now given a choice to edit the project source
   file in a text editor when you select "Edit Project Properties"

NF-44-I417-023 New On-the-fly casing policy handling (2009-05-06)

   The On_The_Fly casing policy is now activated character-by-character.
   The previous behavior (activated after each word) has been renamed
   End_Of_Word.

NF-44-I406-008 Support for source navigation in SPARK annotations (2009-07-09)

   GPS can now take advantage of .sli files (similar to GNAT .ali files for
   SPARK annotations) when generated by the new SPARK Examiner switch -sli.

NF-44-I405-005 New plug-in autognatpp.py (2009-04-06)

   A new optional plug-in is provided as an alternative to autoformat.py
   which will call gnatpp on each file save instead of calling the internal
   code reformatter.

NF-44-I401-007 New preference to select a default VCS (2009-04-06)

   In the VCS pane of the Preferences dialog, the preference "Default VCS"
   can be used to select a default VCS which will be used by GPS when the
   projects do not define a VCS.

NF-44-I330-004 VCS sorting on status is now stable (2009-04-01)

   GPS now ensures that the sort on VCS statuses is stable and that entries
   for files having the same status are sorted alphabetically on file base
   names.

NF-44-I329-003 Support for conditional expressions (2009-03-30)

   The Ada source editor now knows about new Ada 201x conditional expression
   and computes indentation accordingly.

NF-44-I325-023 Support for multi-unit files in project properties (2009-04-02)

   It is now possible to manipulate multi-unit source files in the naming
   tab of the project properties editor

NF-44-I323-007 New plug-in: first_subtype.py (2009-03-23)

   Adds a new contextual menu entry to jump to the first subtype of an
   Ada type

NF-44-I320-013 SPARK plug-in enhancements (2009-09-04)

  The project is reloaded/recomputed after Examining SPARK source code and
  simplifying a vcg file, to take into account new created files and
  directories.
  Other SPARK file extensions are also registered.
  The Simplifier Output window is raised after Simplifying a vcg file.

NF-44-I304-017 Tooltip in locations window (2009-03-13)

   A tooltip appears when leaving the mouse on items in the Locations view.
   This is useful to view long messages without having to scroll the view
   horizontally.

NF-44-I302-024 New builder module macro "%TT" (2009-04-16)

   A new macro "%TT" is available in the Builder Module. This expands to the
   full path to a main file in the project tree.
   This is useful when using the Builder Module to drive tools which need the
   full path rather than the base name of main files.

NF-44-I217-007 Entities browser preserves source order (2009-02-17)

   When a record is analyzed in the entities browser, its fields are now
   displayed in the same order as in the source code

NF-44-I210-006 New plug-in: gnatpp_switches.py (2009-08-11)

   This optional plug-in will automatically scan gnatpp switches in your
   project, and set the corresponding GPS reformatting preferences accordingly.

NF-44-I205-024 Outline view updated in real-time (2009-04-10)

   The Outline View is now updated after each edition in the buffer: it is no
   longer required to save the buffer in order for the Outline View to reflect
   the changes in the file.

NF-44-I205-022 Enhance the documentation generation of sourcecode (2009-09-25)

   The GPS documentation generator has been enhanced to provide full source
   code browsing capabilities in html format. In particular, it is now
   possible to navigate to/from specs/bodies of entities in the 'htmlized'
   sources.s

NF-44-I205-020 Add Unified visual comparison mode (2009-03-04)

   A new "Mode" preference in the "Visual diff" section allows displaying of
   visual comparisons in the fashion of Unified diff, ie with the differences
   shown directly in the editor, rather than in a new editor.

NF-44-I202-016 Support selection of multiple activities (2009-02-10)

   Actions on the VCS Activities explorer can now be done on multiple
   activities. For example, it is possible to delete or commit all selected
   activities.

NF-44-I129-010 Improved cross references loading time (2009-02-27)

   Cross references are now loaded much faster by GPS. This brings a
   significant improvement when e.g. displaying tooltips on very big projects.

NF-44-I128-006 Expanded code directly in the editors (2009-04-10)

   The contextual menu "Expanded code" on Ada sources allows displaying of the
   expanded code directly in the editor. Also, you can select to display the
   expanded code for the current subprogram only.

NF-44-I122-033 Meaningful source editor titles (2009-02-04)

   GPS now uses more meaningful titles for source editors used to store
   version control related information: specific file revisions, file logs or
   activity logs.

NF-44-I120-054 Ability to specify font for annotation comments (2009-02-04)

   It is now possible to specify a different font for annotation comments.
   Previousely, the font for regular comments was always used for special
   comments.

NF-44-I116-026 Fixing "abstract must come before new" (2009-01-19)

   An automatic fix is now proposed for "abstract must come before new" error
   messages.

NF-44-I109-036 Complete gnatpp switches in the project editor (2009-01-20)

   GPS now handles the newer gnatpp switches in the 'Pretty Print' page of the
   project editor.

NF-44-HC10-025 SPARK keywords highlighting (2009-09-09)

  SPARK keywords (such as assert, check, ...) are now higlighted in source
  editors using the keyword font when found in SPARK annotations.

NF-44-HC08-012 Support for SPARK Toolset 7.6.2 (2008-12-10)

  GPS is now compatible with version 7.6.2 of the SPARK Toolset.

NF-44-HA29-024 Renamed entities added into locations view (2009-07-18)

   Entries are added into the locations view for entities renamed using GPS
   code refactoring. It is then easier to review all the renamed entities.

NF-44-HA23-007 New menus in Edit->Selection (2008-10-23)

  The following new menus are available under Edit->Selection:
  - Move Left/Right: shift the selection one character left or right
  - Serialize: automatically increment a number in a set of adjacent lines
  - Untabify: replace tabs with spaces in the selection

NF-44-HA21-047 listvars.py plugin can show non-local variables (2009-02-02)

  This plug in shows which variables are used by a subprogram. It now provides
  a second contextual menu to show only non-local variables

NF-44-HA03-020 File changed dialog checks for diffs (2008-10-03)

  When GPS detects that a file has changed on the disk, it displays
  a dialog giving the choice between reloading the file or overriding
  it. This check now uses both the timestamp (as before) and checking
  the actual contents of the file, so that it pops up less often, in
  particular when external tools are changing the timestamps

NF-44-HA03-015 Double-clicking in breakpoint window (2008-10-03)

  It is now possible to double-click in the list of breakpoints in
  the breakpoints editor window to jump to any of these locations.

NF-44-HA02-006 Hyper-links in the editors (2009-09-01)

  Pressing the ctrl key turns entities in the editors into hyperlinks:
  clicking on an entity reference jumps to the declaration, and clicking on
  a declaration jumps to the implementation.
  Clicking with the middle button on a reference jumps directly to the
  implementation.

NF-44-H927-002 Speed up update VCS action (2008-10-29)

  It is now possible to disable status operation after an update.
  This speed-up the update action as status is an expensive
  operation. On slow network it can make a big difference.
  At the same time GPS has been enhanced to parse the update output
  to update file status accordingly.

NF-44-H908-010 shell.py supports colors and completion (2008-11-14)

  The shell.py plugin allows you to open a window with a system shell.
  It now supports completion (if your shell does) and colors, as well
  as being able to run more complex applications like vi

NF-44-H904-015 Minor optimization for handling VCS status (2008-12-09)

  The local file statuses where not used to override current statuses
  on the VCS explorer. It is now updating the VCS explorer as long
  as the local status won't override a remote status (Needs update or
  Needs merge).

NF-44-H707-022 Minor improvements in GNATCheck integration (2009-01-20)

  The GNATCheck rules editor menu has been renamed, and the rules editor
  now lets you choose whether you want to see the resulting file after
  exiting the editor.

NF-44-H223-004 Auto fixes for "missing string quote" (2009-02-24)

  An auto-fix is now offered for message like "missing string quote", adding
  the missing quote.

NF-44-GC11-019 Custom hyperlinks in source editors (2009-09-03)

  It is now possible in GPS to create hyperlinks in the editor, through Python
  customization.

NF-44-GB03-007 Export debugger data window to png (2008-10-01)

  The debugger Data window can now be exported to png like all
  other browsers. Export to SVG is not fully supported yet.

NF-44-GA25-013 Dereferencing all items in debugger data window (2008-10-03)

  A new contextual menu is now available in boxes in the data window of
  the debugger. When you select this menu all the pointers visible in the
  box are automatically dereferenced and new boxes created appropriately.
  This is faster than clicking on each pointer in turn.

NF-44-G903-012 Call stack window cleared while running (2008-10-02)

  The debugger callstack is now cleared while the debugged program is
  running or has terminated to avoid confusion arising from an outdated
  callstack.

NF-44-G903-006 Report all style errors at once (2008-12-11)

  When running the style checkers (on files and logs) GPS will
  now report errors from all files and will not stop checking
  on the first file violating some styles.

NF-44-G611-027 Improvements in the C indentation engine (2009-08-12)

  Various improvements have been made to better indent C and C++ code
  automatically. In particular, expressions inside parentheses and curly
  brackets are better aligned.

NF-44-G510-012 Auto-fix for "use explicit pragma Pack" (2009-02-24)

  An auto-fix is now offered for message like "size for T is too small,
  use explicit pragma Pack", automatically adding a pragma Pack for the entity.

NF-44-F819-004 New menu to display derived type hierarchy (2009-07-31)

   A new contextual menu which displays the derived type hierarchy is
   available: Display type hierarchy for xxx.

NF-44-F327-008 Auto-fix for "suggested replacement" (2009-02-24)

  An auto fix is now offered for messages like "suggested replacement",
  automatically applying the replacement suggested by the compiler.

NF-44-EB18-010 Entity View (2009-07-15)

  GPS now has an Entity View, which allows you to browse through all entities
  present in the project.
  The Entity View can be accessed through the menu Tools->Views->Entities.

NF-44-E817-003 Message on the VCS Explorer when no VCS defined (2008-10-27)

  When no VCS is defined on the root project and all projects it
  depends on a message is displayed into the VCS Explorer.

NF-44-DB04-011 New auto VCS mode (2008-10-27)

  The new "auto" VCS_Kind mode can be used to let GPS automatically select
  the proper external VCS. This is useful in the context where different
  people are not using the same VCS locally. For example developers
  tracking a Subversion repository using Git (git-svn module).
  This is the default behavior when no VCS is specified in the Project.

NF-44-DA05-006 Support for VCS without log (2008-12-23)

  It is now possible to create a VCS that do not require a log
  (logs are handled by external commands like ClearCase GUI for
  example). In this case GPS won't ask for a log file while
  doing the commit/add/remove VCS actions.

NF-44-DA05-003 VCS menus are now filtered (2008-11-03)

  The main VCS menu is filtered to contain only the VCS actions
  which are at least defined in one generic VCS. The VCS
  Activities menu is also filtered to propose actions that
  are available on the project VCS.
