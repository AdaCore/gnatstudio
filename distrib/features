FC04-010 Support for macro substitution in <filter> nodes (2006-12-05)

  In XML customization files, it is now possible to use %F,... in a
  <filter> node

F130-004 PyGTK distributed with GPS (2006-12-01)

  PyGTK is now distributed with GPS on most platforms, and allows very
  flexible and powerful UI interaction. It is also now possible to create
  widgets with PyGTK and include them in the GPS MDI. It is also possible to
  get the MDI contents and export it to PyGTK

  Keywords: Python

New features in GPS 4.0.1
-------------------------

F725-001 Support for leon-elf toolchain (2006-08-24)

  The project properties editor now lists the leon-elf toolchain as one of
  the choices.

F710-013 Better formatting of the debugger data window items (2006-09-19)
  The text displayed in the debugger data window items now uses the default
  fixed font. This allow a better rendering in particular when displaying
  registers content.

F618-002 Support for python (2006-08-11)

  All GPS binaries are now built with python support enabled, allowing
  very flexible scripting capabilities.

  Keywords: Python

New features in GPS 4.0.0
-------------------------

F615-006 Alias expansion is case insensitive (2006-06-16)

  The process of matching alias names is now case insensitive. This is
  friendlier as it allows to expand an alias no matter the alias name casing.
  This is particularly useful when the on the fly auto-casing is being used.

  Keywords: Aliases

F613-014 Key shortcuts editor improvements (2006-06-16)

  The keyshortcuts editor has been improved: entries are sorted by categories,
  and when several key bindings are associated with the same action, they are
  all listed

F523-012 Support for debugger watchpoints (2006-06-15)

  Support for watchpoints (also known as breakpoint on variables) is
  added in the breakpoint editor.

  Keywords: Debugger

F503-004 Block information on record/union/class (2006-05-05)

  GPS computes block information for record/union/class and has associated
  navigation actions to move to the start or the end of such block. Block
  folding is also possible which is very convenient for large records.

  Keywords: Editor, Block

F424-012 Smart Ada code completion (2006-06-09)

  GPS can now complete Ada identifiers using the entities database. Possible
  completions include simple identifier completion, and completion after '.'
  in many cases.

  The completion engine extracts documentation from comments surrounding
  declarations, and displays them interactively.

  Keywords: Editor, Completion

F409-010 Ada auto block completion (2006-05-02)

  A new action named Block_Completion has been implemented. This action will
  close the current Ada statement or unit. It handles if, case, loop
  (with optional label), declare block (with optional label), procedure,
  function and package.

  Keywords: Editor, Block

F407-003 Improved Call Tree Views (2006-04-27)

  The Call Tree Views are reorganized to separate the list of locations from
  the tree itself, and now support keyboard navigation.

F324-019 Support for UNC paths under Windows (2006-04-03)

  Support for UNC paths under Windows via the file and directory selectors
  as well as under the various tools (e.g. builder, debugger) is now available.

F321-004 Activities can be re-opened (2006-03-21)

  A committed (closed) activity can now be re-opened for complementary
  work like adding some files to it for example.

  Keyword: VCS

F316-006 Automatic fix for redundant with clause in body warning (2006-03-20)

  After a build GPS recognizes the 'redundant with clause in body' warning
  as fixable. The obvious correction is the removal of the corresponding
  clause.

F315-016 New Revision View (2006-03-19)

  In addition to having the revision log as plain text a revision view
  has been implemented. This structured view helps browsing large revision
  tree by showing branches in a clean hierarchy.

  Keywords: VCS

F302-022 Fixing messages "Var is never read and never asigned" (2006-06-13)

  The new GNAT message "Var is never read and never asigned" is now
  automatically fixed in GPS, by removing or commenting the useless variable.

F223-022 New preference for the debugger: "Always open main unit" (2006-02-27)

  A new preference was added to the debugger support, so that it is now
  possible to choose whether GPS should automatically open the program's
  main unit when the debugger is initialized.

  Keywords: Debugger

F222-017 New key shortcut for Build->Run-><first main>

  A new keyboard shortcut (Shift-F2) is added by default for the first main
  unit in the menu Build->Run. It is now also possible to set key shortcuts
  more easily on the Build->Run and Build->Debug menu items.

  Keywords: Shortcut, Menu

F122-003 Support for tags and branches (2006-04-09)

  GPS has basic support for tags and branches. A set of actions has been
  added to create a tag or branch tag, to switch to a specific branch, to
  compare the local version of a file against a tag or branch tag and to
  merge changes from a specific branch.

  Keywords: VCS

F316-016 New action to get source of a specific revision (2006-04-09)

  A new action has been added to get the full source of a specific file at
  a given revision number. This is tightly integrated with the new Revision

  A new example has been included in the GPS distribution, called
  share/examples/gps/python/ispell.py

  Keywords: Python

F209-010 New port: x86-64 GNU/Linux (2006-03-03)

  GPS has been ported to the x86-64 GNU/Linux platform, taking full

  menu. If the underlying VCS supports commit for directories then it is also
  possible to commit a directory or add a directory to an activity.

  Keywords: VCS

F119-003 Window position no longer saved in the desktop

  The GPS window position is no longer saved in the desktop. This is in fact
  better handled by the windowing system, which has better knowledge of the

  package P is
  --  Align on line above, do not extra indent when this preference is set

  Keyword: Indentation

F104-029 New "record indentation" preference (2006-03-22)

  A new preference to refine how Ada sources are indented is added, to
  define how much extra spaces are used to indent "record" type definitions,
