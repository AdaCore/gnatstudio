New features on 4.4.0
---------------------

NF-44-HA23-007 New menus in Edit->Selection (2008-10-23)

  The following new menus are available under Edit->Selection:
  - Move Left/Right: shift the selection one character left or right
  - Serialize: automatically increment a number in a set of adjacent lines
  - Untabify: replace tabs with spaces in the selection

NF-44-HA03-020 File changed dialog checks for diffs (2008-10-03)

  When GPS detects that a file has changed on the disk, it displays
  a dialog giving the choice between reloading the file or overriding
  it. This check now uses both the timestamp (as before) and checking
  the actual contents of the file, so that it pops up less often, in
  particular when external tools are changing the timestamps

NF-44-HA03-015 Double-clicking in breakpoint window (2008-10-03)

  It is now possible to double-click in the list of breakpoints in
  the breakpoints editor window to jump to any of these locations.

NF-44-GB03-007 Export debugger data window to png (2008-10-01)

  The debugger Data window can now be exported to png like all
  other browsers. Export to SVG is not fully supported yet.

NF-44-GA25-013 Dereferencing all items in debugger data window (2008-10-03)

  A new contextual menu is now available in boxes in the data window of
  the debugger. When you select this menu all the pointers visible in the
  box are automatically dereferenced and new boxes created appropriately.
  This is faster than clicking on each pointer in turn.

NF-44-G903-012 Call stack window cleared while running (2008-10-02)

  The debugger callstack is now cleared while the debugged program is
  running or has terminated to avoid confusion arising from an outdated
  callstack.

NF-44-E817-003 Message on the VCS Explorer when no VCS defined (2008-10-27)

  When no VCS is defined on the root project and all projects it
  depends on a message is displayed into the VCS Explorer.

NF-44-DB04-011 New auto VCS mode (2008-10-27)

  The new "auto" VCS_Kind mode can be used to let GPS automatically select
  the proper external VCS. This is useful in the context where different
  people are not using the same VCS locally. For example developers
  tracking a Subversion repository using Git (git-svn module).
