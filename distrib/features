New features in GPS 5.2.0 / GNATbench 2.7.0
-------------------------------------------

NF-52-L329-026 GPS: Improved emacs selection mode support (2012-03-30)

  When using the emacs mode, after setting a mark, the commands to go to the
  beginning and end of line will extend the selection.

NF-52-L329-021 GPS: isearch.py stores result of ctrl+w in history (2012-03-29)

  When you start a search (ctrl+s) and then use ctrl+w to copy parts of the
  current identifier as the search pattern, this pattern is now stored
  immediately in the history. That way, cancelling the search and restarting
  it with ctrl+s ctrl+s will search what was copied (we used to update the
  pattern only after you pressed ctrl+s a second time after ctrl+w).
  This is closer to Emacs' behavior.

NF-52-L320-004 GPS: simplify Default Builder preference (2012-03-20)

  The Default Builder preference has been simplified, with the following
  changes:
    - 'Gprmake' setting removed, since gprmake is no longer supported;
    - 'Gprbuild' setting renamed 'Auto', more accurate;
    - 'Gprbuild_Always' setting renamed 'Gprbuild', for consistency with the
      'Gnatmake' setting.

  Note that if you were using a non default setting for this preference, you
  will need to reset it manually.

NF-52-L227-030 GB: project names need not be legal Ada identifiers (2012-03-09)

  The name of an Eclipse/Workbench project need not conform to the rules for
  Ada identifiers.  This change applies to both new projects and as well as
  existing Eclipse/Workbench projects to be converted to GNATbench use.

NF-52-L213-028 GPS: new command GPS.EditorLocation.inside_word (2012-02-13)

  A new Shell/Python command allows determining whether a location is inside a
  word. This is useful when creating editor plugins.

NF-52-L211-002 GPS: wildcard support in Open From Project (2012-04-09)

  Wildcards characters are now taken into account in the "Open From Project..."
  dialog.

NF-52-L124-025 GPS: improvements in auto_highlight_occurrences.py (2012-02-16)

  The plugin auto_highlight_occurrences.py has two new features:
    - if there is a selection, the other occurrences of the selected text
      will be highlighted in the editor
    - if the cursor is on a word which is not a navigable entity (for instance
      keywords, words in comments, or in languages other than Ada or C), GPS
      will perform a text-based highlighting of this word

  Both of these behaviors can be deactivated through the Preferences dialog,
  section Plugins->auto_highlight_occurrences.

NF-52-L109-019 GPS: goto next/previous bookmark (2012-01-23)

  Two new actions ("Goto Next Bookmark" and "Goto Previous Bookmark") are
  available to jump to nearest bookmarks in current file.
  They can be bound to keys in the "General" section of the Key Shortcuts
  dialog.

NF-52-L109-016 GPS: New action "Delete Line" (2012-01-11)

  This action deletes the current line and places the cursor on the beginning
  of the following line.
  It can be bound to a key in the "Editor" section of the Key Shortcuts dialog.

NF-52-L101-003 GB: display task info in debug view (2012-01-10)

  Ada task information is now displayed in the debug view.  This feature can
  be enabled/disabled from the debug view menu.

NF-52-KC20-002 GPS: License updated to GPL3 (2011-12-20)

  GPS is now licensed under the terms of the GPL version 3.

NF-52-KC07-036 GPS: doc converted to sphinx (2011-12-08)

  The documentation format was changed, so that we can produce nicer
  looking output. In particular, the new format provides an integrated
  search feature over all pages of the manual.

NF-52-KA28-027 GPS: new Editor action "toggle wrapping" (2011-10-28)

  A new action "toggle wrapping" is defined in the plugin text_utils.py,
  and can be associated to a key binding in the Key Shortcuts editor to
  conveniently switch between no wrapping and word wrapping in the current
  editor.

NF-52-KA27-013 GPS: improved smart completion on C/C++ (2012-03-19)

  GPS incorporates support to analyze the context and provide better
  proposals for smart completion of C/C++ entities, including cases
  like: x.field, x->field, x.method, x->method, x[...][...]->field,
  x[...][...]->method, and class::method.

NF-52-KA03-005 GPS: force use of gprbuild (2011-12-06)

  It is now possible to always use gprbuild as a builder for projects,
  whether these projects are multi-language or not. This is done via the
  new preference 'Default builder', using the 'Gprbuild_Always' setting.
  This preference replaces the previous 'Multi language builder' preference.

NF-52-K907-014 GPS: Navigation from Ada to C++ (2011-10-26)

  GPS now incorporates support for navigating through Ada entities imported
  from C++.

  Two alternatives are now suggested to quick fix an unreferenced object:
  either remove the object declaration or add a pragma unreferenced.

NF-52-K225-019 Improved indentation of comments within expressions (2012-02-20)

  Comments within expressions or as part of continuation lines are better
  indented, taking the extra continuation line preference into account.

NF-52-K223-021 GPS: Automatic removal of Subversion errors (2011-10-28)

  Errors emitted by Subversion are removed from the Locations view when the
  file containing errors is committed successfully or reverted.

NF-52-K121-030 GPS: Codefix support for unrequired out-mode (2011-10-21)

  Added support to automatically fix the warning reported by the GNAT
  compiler in in-out formal parameters.

NF-52-JA26-020 Improved indentation in parenthesized exprs (2012-02-20)

  'or else' and 'and then' constructs at the end of lines inside parenthesized
  expressions are better intended and in particular no longer generate an
  extra indentation on the next line.

  The GPS function MDI.input_dialog used in plug-ins has been enhanced and
  now offers multi-line input on fields as an option.

  Added Ada-specific launch configurations for local and remote debugging,
  attaching to a running process, and post mortem debugging.

  this location in an editor, and it is now possible to click the "Back" button
  in the toolbar to go back to the Code Coverage report.

NF-52-FB01-013 ECL: Missing right-click debug options in editor (2011-10-12)

  The Ada editor now supports debug context menu items for run to line, move
  to line, resume at line, add watch expression, and ruler context menu items
  toggle breakpoint, enabled/disable breakpoint, and breakpoint properties.

NF-52-D528-005 GPS: UI: add custom radio menu items (2012-03-27)
