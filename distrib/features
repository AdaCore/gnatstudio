New features in GPS 4.3.0
-------------------------

NF-43-GB27-021 Command line pretty printer using GPS reformating (2007-11-28)

  An new python example demonstrates how to reformat all sources of a project
  with a single command line. The result is the same as opening each source
  file of the project, selecting the whole buffer and executing the
  "Format Selection" action (bound to Control-Tab by default). This example
  is named reformat_project.py and the usage is detailed in the file itself.

NF-43-GB14-004 New VCS action to prepare group commit in one click (2007-11-17)

  The new VCS action "Commit as new Activity" has been implemented to simplify
  simple group-commit activity. Calling this action will create an anonymous
  activity, populate it with all selected files from the VCS Explorer and
  open the activity log file. Just fill it and commit the activity.

NF-43-GB07-006 Major speed up in project view (2007-11-26)

  The computation time for the project view was greatly improved, and the
  view displays much faster now on big projects.
