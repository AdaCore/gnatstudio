This file lists a summary of the new features introduced in GPS. For more
details, please see the documentation.

New features in GPS 2.1.0

- D625-008 AUnit integration has been enhanced. It is now possible to select
  the directory in which the generated code is saved. The generated code is
  now following the GNAT Style convention so it can be compiled with the
  standard -gnaty switch.

- DA13-006 New menu Help->GNAT Runtime

- DA07-011 GPS.Locations.parse can now specify the highlighting colors to use
  in the editor (similar to what is done for standard build failures)

- Relative paths in Project View: use absolute paths if the only common part
  of the path is the root directory of the file system

- D930-017: New preference to chose whether the toolbar should be displayed

- Customability enhancements: New project attributes and new preferences can
  now be defined in XML files

- New preference "Multi language build" to choose between gnatmake and gprmake
  to build projects with Ada and C/C++.

- New multi-language build tool: gprmake
  This tool replaces the gpr2make tool. This is a preliminary version,
  still under development.

- Minor updates in python support: GPS.Hook.add now takes a subprogram as a
  parameter, instead of a string. This is the more usual syntax for python
  users

- Script updates:
  new classes GPS.Process, GPS.Toolbar, GPS.GUI, GPS.Menu, GPS.Console
  API change for GPS.Preference (import GPS_old.py for the old API)

- New menu Help->Python Extensions
  Improved documentation for python scripting, including more examples

- Basic support added for several languages (source highlighting,...)

- New project attributes can be defined through XML files

- D802-011 New contextual menu "Go to type declaration of"

- D607-009 USERPROFILE taken into account
  In particular under Windows, this environment variable is defined in place
  of HOME under Unix. GPS now takes it into account for storing information.

- D617-014 Python commands' output can now be redirected to any GPS window

- GPS can recompute the indentation for an alias after its expansion

- Improved indentation of C/C++ struct, class, union constructs

- D525-015 New preference for indentation of variable declaration
  So that it is possible to choose whether alignment of continuation lines
  for variable delcaration is performed based on the 'colon' character, or
  based on the first non blank character.

- New command refill to wrap text or comment according to the right margin as
  defined by the column highlight editor's preference.

- New shell commands, to ease writing of GPS scripts. See 'help' in the
  GPS shell for a full list of GPS commands.

[ Note: the following two entries are only provided when GPS is built with
  XML/Ada ]

- Better error messages when parsing customization XML files.

- Full support of XML features in XML customization files (entities,...)
