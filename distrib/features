New features in GPS 6.0.0 / GNATbench 2.8.0
-------------------------------------------

NF-60-M712-005 GPS: support for displays with 16 bpp (2013-07-12)

  GPS now supports displays with a color depth of 16 bits per pixels.

NF-60-M712-004 GPS: syntax highlighting of aspects (2013-07-29)

  Ada 2012 and SPARK 2014 aspects are highlighted with a different color
  configurable via the preferences, so that these are easily found when
  editing source files.

NF-60-M711-028 GPS: tooltip while scrolling in editors (2013-07-11)

  When manipulating an editor scrollbar with the mouse, a tooltip is
  displayed that shows the current line and entity.

NF-60-M710-029 GPS: display size of selection in editors (2013-07-10)

  When a selection exists in an editor, the status bar will display the
  number of characters and lines that are selected.

NF-60-M710-025 GPS: display build progress when build completes (2013-07-10)

  When a build terminates on failure, GPS now displays the total progress
  (as displayed by the task manager) in the console. This makes it easier to
  know how many files were compiled up to the first compilation error.

NF-60-M709-025 GPS: reopen messages window as needed (2013-07-10)

  There are various backdoors in GPS that makes it possible to close the
  Messages window. GPS will now automatically reopen it as needed.

NF-60-M708-023 GPS: middle-click on tab closes the window (2013-07-08)

  This is close to the behavior most web browsers implement and is a
  convenient way to quickly close a number of tabs.

NF-60-M705-044 GPS: rotation text in notebook tabs (2013-07-08)

  It is now possible, via the contextual menu on each notebook tab, to
  change the orientation of the text. For instance, displaying the tabs
  on the left will by default rotate the text bottom-to-top, thus saving
  horizontal space.

NF-60-M705-018 GPS: clean up Plug-ins dialog (2013-07-05)

  The plug-ins dialog has been simplified. It no longer shows the python
  files that are mandatory for GPS. It no longer supports custom
  initialization commands for the modules (since standard python can be
  used for this). The implementation of the plug-ins is now accessible via
  an hyper link, instead of being displayed in this dialog.

NF-60-M625-035 GPS: style for build buttons in the toolbar (2013-07-01)

  The rendering has been modified for the build buttons in the toolbar,
  so that they occupy less space, while making it clearer that they have
  a popdown menu to select their build target.

NF-60-M625-005 GPS: approximate search (2013-06-25)

  GPS is now able to do approximate search. For instance, searching for
  "saerch" will also match "search" when this mode is activated.

NF-60-M621-005 GPS: new plugin formatfile.py (2013-06-21)

  This plugin, when loaded, adds a new menu /Edit/Format Whole File
  which reformats the whole file while preserving the current cursor
  location.

NF-60-M620-018 GPS: color schemes (2013-06-20)

  A new preference is available to select color schemes. This effects other
  preferences and can be used to set dark colors for the background of
  editors and windows.

NF-60-M617-030 GPS: apply preferences on the fly (2013-06-17)

  The Apply button was removed from the preferenes dialog.
  Instead, GPS will be refreshed every time any of the settings is modified.

NF-60-M606-028 GPS: remove Open From Project dialog (2013-06-07)

  The menu /Files/Open From Project no longer opens up a dialog. Instead,
  it moves the focus to the global search field. This provides on-the-fly
  completion, fuzzy matching,...

NF-60-M603-060 GPS: remove Goto Entity dialog (2013-06-07)

  The menu /Navigate/Goto Entity no longer opens up a dialog. Instead it
  moves the focus to the global search field. The /Tools/Views/Entity
  view was also removed since its features are now available through the
  global search field.

NF-60-M530-024 GPS: only save changed preferences (2013-07-04)

  GPS will now only save those preferences that have been modified into
  its HOME/.gps/preferences file. This change should be mostly invisible
  to users, except when changing versions of GPS where the new default
  will be picked up automatically.

NF-60-M529-012 GPS: execute_extended.py plugin removed (2013-05-29)

  This plugin allows one to easily execute any of the GPS commands via the
  keyboard. This behavior is now directly available via the new global search
  box in the GPS toolbar.

NF-60-M524-041 Improved indentation of parenthesized expressions (2013-06-20)

  Extra spaces following an open parenthesis is now taken into account
  when indenting Ada code.

NF-60-M523-031 GPS: add search field in the global toolbar (2013-05-27)

  A search field is now provided, which will look simultaneously in various
  context (source file names, entities,...).

NF-60-M424-019 Improved indentation of conditional expressions (2013-05-17)

  Ada 2012 If-expressions and case-expressions are better handled by the
  indentation engine and in particular extra indentation levels are used for
  each case branch.

NF-60-M411-022 GPS: Aliases expansion directly in editor (2013-06-01)

  The aliases expansion feature now works directly in-editor, without
  presenting the user a dialog for aliases with parameters. The user progresses
  through the fields directly in the editor via the Ctrl+Tab shortcut. Visual
  feedback is provided for the current field via highlighting.

NF-60-M329-013 GPS: translucent highlighting colors (2013-03-29)

  It is now possible to specify translucent colors for error messages,
  current lines,... in the editors. This is a convenient solution so that
  the current line also shows whether it has an associated error.

NF-60-M318-031 GB: warning editing files not part of a GB project (2013-05-13)

  When the Ada editor opens a file not part of a GNATbench project, a dialog is
  displayed to inform the user that some features will not work properly until
  the file is part of a GNATbench project.
  This dialog can be disabled through Ada Editor Preferences page.

NF-60-M315-025 WB: enable DFW_ENABLE_ADA_SYMBOL_CHECK at startup (2013-05-17)

  On Wind River Workbench 3.3 or later, Ada expressions watch feature requires
  DFW_ENABLE_ADA_SYMBOL_CHECK environment variable to be set to 1.
  If not set, Expressions view is not able to display current values of records
  and arrays variables.
  This feature can be disabled using Ada General preferences page.

NF-60-M307-008 GPS: refactoring of highlighter.py (2013-03-27)

  This python module is used as the basis for all python scripts that need to
  highlight (part of) editors. In particular, you can easily extend it to
  highlight specific text or regular expressions in your buffer. This script
  now provides an OverlayStyle class, which supports more properties than
  before (in particular, you can strike through or underline specific text
  in your editors with just a few lines of code).

NF-60-M301-031 New review classification of CodePeer messages (2013-06-13)

  When doing a manual review of a CodePeer message, the user can
  no longer change the message ranking, but instead specify a review
  classification and the name of the reviewer. New message review dialog is
  added and new filter was added for CodePeer Report view to manage visibility
  of messages by review status.

NF-60-M218-036 GPS: GPS.MDI.add to put on top of consoles (2013-06-07)

  The python function GPS.MDI.add now has additional parameters to specify
  the initial location of the new widget. This allows you to put widgets on
  top of the existing GPS consoles for instance.

NF-60-M205-030 ECL: navigation problems are announced (2013-05-24)

  When navigation functions, such as hyperlinks and goto-spec/body, encounter
  problems due to lack of compilation or use of foreign Ada source files, these
  problems are announced via warning and errors dialog boxes.  Users have the
  option to disable these dialogs with a checkbox on the dialogs themselves,
  for convenience.

NF-60-M204-035 ECL: automatic scenario set for Android projects (2013-02-04)

  When the new-project wizard creates a new Ada for Android project
  the "OS" scenario variable will be set to "linux" automatically.
  This setting is essential for creating proper library names for subsequent
  use by the Android OS.

NF-60-M129-023 GPS: simplified CodePeer report window (2013-03-11)

  The CodePeer report window has been simplified to improve usability and
  remove unneeded information. Access to the various filters is also
  improved.

NF-60-M129-002 GPS: return block completion (2013-02-04)

  Add "return ... end return;" statement support for complete block
  completion

NF-60-M124-022 GPS: preserve location in new views (2013-06-06)

  When creating a new view for an editor (for instance through drag-and-drop)
  the new view is now displayed at the same location as the original editor,
  rather than on the first line.

NF-60-M122-025 GPS: filter in the outline view (2013-01-23)

  A filter has been added to the Outline view to make it easier to find
  entities.

NF-60-M121-011 GPS: Outline has a flat view mode (2013-01-21)

  It is now possible to display all entities at the same level, rather than
  nested hierarchically. In some cases, it makes searching for an entity
  easier.

NF-60-M111-033 GPS: Refill automatically computes paragraph (2013-01-11)

  The menu /Edit/Selection/Refill will now either apply to the current
  selection if it exists (as before), or automatically compute the extents
  of the current paragraph to reformat (instead of only applying to the
  current line).

NF-60-M110-025 GPS: group spec and body in Outline view (2013-01-10)

  It is now possible to group the spec and body (or spec and full view) for an
  entity on the same row in the Outline view, to reduce the total height of
  the Outline view. Clicking on the name of the entity will jump to its spec,
  but if this is already the current location in the editor will jump to its
  body instead.

NF-60-M109-036 GPS: autofix on missing constant with preferences (2013-01-21)

  Autofix has always done fixes in lowercases. This enhancement performs
  the fixes on missing constants following the user defined preferences
  specified in Preferences/Editor/Ada/Reserved word casing

NF-60-M108-041 GPS: line wrapping in Messages window (2013-01-09)

  It is now possible to configure whether the Messages window should wrap
  lines, or require horizontal scrolling.

NF-60-M102-006 GPS: move Serialize to /Edit/Rectangle/ (2013-01-11)

  This menu was previously in /Edit/Selection, but is more logical in the
  Rectangle submenu since it conceptually applies to a rectangle.

NF-60-LC21-017 GPS: Update to Scenario View (2013-01-08)

  The Scenario view has been updated to a more usable tree rendering.

NF-60-LC06-024 GPS: Locations view has a toolbar (2012-12-06)

  Actions such as "clear locations", or the filter panel were now moved into
  that toolbar to make them more accessible. The preference "Auto Jump To First
  Location" was removed from the preferences menu and moved to the toolbar as
  well.

NF-60-LC06-015 GPS: tab menu allows easy selection of open tabs (2012-12-17)

  The right-click menu on notebook tabs now shows the list of all windows open
  in that tabs, to ease navigation.

NF-60-LC03-011 GPS: local toolbars for views (2012-12-03)

  A number of views now have a local toolbar. They also display their
  configuration settings in a local menu rather than in the Preferences
  dialog or the contextual menu.

NF-60-LB29-021 GPS: remove status bar (2012-11-29)

  The status bar has been removed. It was only used to display the current
  tasks in progress, and the corresponding progress bars were moved to the
  right of the toolbar, replacing the throbber.

NF-60-LB29-006 GPS: use ellipsis in window titles (2012-11-28)

  The text in the title bars and in the notebook tabs will now use ellipsis
  ("...") when the window is too small to accomodate the whole text. The size
  of notebook tabs is also limited so that we do not end up with a single tab
  using most of the notebook widths, thus hidding the others. This behavior
  is controlled by a new preference Window/Homogeneous Tabs.

NF-60-LB26-025 GPS: clickable qualified name in editor status bars (2012-12-13)

  The name of the current subprogram, as displayed in the editors status bars,
  now includes the name of the enclosing subprograms and packages. Each of
  these names is clickable to easily jump to the beginning of the enclosing
  block.

NF-60-LB20-022 GPS: Key shortcuts dialog display improved (2012-11-21)

  The display of the key shortcuts in this dialog now matches what is
  done for the toplevel menus, using symbols like up arrow for the shift
  key, a caret sign for the control key, and the special symbols for
  Mac keyboards.

NF-60-LB15-037 GPS: EditorOverlay can now highlight a whole line (2012-12-05)

  The EditorOverlay class can now be used in Python plugins to highlight an
  entire line, through the property "paragraph-background":
    # Create an overlay for an editor:
    b = GPS.EditorBuffer.get(GPS.File ("my_file.adb"))
    o = b.create_overlay("my_overlay_name")

    # Set the paragraph-background property to pink
    o.set_property ("paragraph-background", "#f0c0c0")

    # This highlights the entire line 317 in my file
    b.apply_overlay (o,
       GPS.EditorLocation(b, 317, 1),
       GPS.EditorLocation(b, 317, 1))

NF-60-LB04-004 GB: Export GNATbench preferences like CDT (2013-01-22)

  GNATbench preferences can now be exported via the export preferences wizard
  and imported into another workspace via the import preferences wizard.

NF-60-L926-027 GPS: Project, Files and Windows views pop-ups (2012-11-13)

  Tooltips added to views to help navigation when windows are narrow.

NF-60-L921-032 GPS: Show protected objects in Outline view (2012-10-16)

  Protected and task types/objects and their entries are now visible in
  Outline View. New filter in Outline View "Show tasks, entries, and protected
  types" is used to show/hide these items.

NF-60-L530-025 New cross-reference engine (2013-01-24)

   GPS and GNATbench both have a new xref engine, based on sqlite. This new
   engine is expected to bring extra performance (since the xref database
   becomes persistent across sessions and GPS will no longer need to parse ALI
   files on the fly), as well as more stability (by using an external process
   to fill the database, and relying on sqlite's very good stability).

NF-60-L510-040 GPS: search in the current selection (2013-01-31)

   GPS can now limit Find and replace operations to the currently selected
   text. This is done by selecting the scope "Current Selection" in the
   Search dialog; this scope is automatically selected when launching the
   dialog while a selection exists in the current editor.

NF-60-J728-022 GPS: the Project Wizard takes advantage of gnatname (2012-11-08)

  The project wizard now optionally uses gnatname to search for Ada units in
  files with non-standard naming conventions.

NF-60-I430-029 GB: Show Ada content in Project Explorer view (2013-03-28)

  GNATbench now uses the Project Explorer view rather than the now deprecated
  GNAT Project Explorer view.  This is the standard view in Eclipse for viewing
  projects, folders, files, etc.  There's also a new view filter that can hide
  any folders/files that are not relevant to the current build configuration.
  Working sets are supported now as well.

NF-60-I424-031 GB: Ada elements now displayed in Properties view (2013-04-22)

  When any element contributed to the Project Explorer or Outline view by
  GNATbench is selected, you will now see properties of that element in the
  Properties view.

NF-60-I320-015 GB: Enhance block completions (2013-01-25)

  The block completion facility has been extended to cover additional
  constructs e.g. extended return statement, protected entry bodies,
  variant parts inside record declarations.

NF-60-H605-006 GPS: Visual indication of completions visibility (2013-04-16)

  In smart completions, entities that are not visible in the current scope
  are now displayed in grey.

NF-60-H603-006 GPS: Aliases auto completion (2013-04-11)

  Aliases can now be completed and expanded by the regular auto-completion
  mechanism.

NF-60-G104-002 WB: Debug tooltip (2013-05-16)

  When debugging an ada application, if the mouse cursor is over a variable
  that can be printed by the debugger, the tooltip displays the variable
  current value. This feature requires WRWB 3.3 or later.
