New features in GPS 6.0.0 / GNATbench 2.8.0
-------------------------------------------

NF-60-LB29-006 GPS: use ellipsis in window titles (2012-11-28)

  The text in the title bars and in the notebook tabs will now use ellipsis
  ("...") when the window is too small to accomodate the whole text. The size
  of notebook tabs is also limited so that we do not end up with a single tab
   using most of the notebook widths, thus hidding the others.

NF-53-LB20-022 GPS: Key shortcuts dialog display improved (2012-11-21)

  The display of the key shortcuts in this dialog now matches what is
  done for the toplevel menus, using symbols like up arrow for the shift
  key, a caret sign for the control key, and the special symbols for
  Mac keyboards.

NF-53-L926-027 GPS: Project, Files and Windows views pop-ups (2012-11-13)

  Tooltips added to views to help navigation when windows are narrow.

NF-53-L921-032 GPS: Show protected objects in Outline view (2012-10-16)

  Protected and task types/objects and their entries are now visible in
  Outline View. New filter in Outline View "Show tasks, entries, and protected
  types" is used to show/hide these items.

NF-53-J728-022 GPS: the Project Wizard takes advantage of gnatname (2012-11-08)

  The project wizard now optionally uses gnatname to search for Ada units in
  files with non-standard naming conventions.
