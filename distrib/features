---------------------

NF-45-IB20-006 Better fixes for undefined entities (2009-11-20)

  Problems such as "entity is undefined" can now be provided with an auto-fix
  even if the compiler didn't find any potential match. A fix is offered if
  there is a unique entity in the project of the appropriate name.

NF-45-IB15-005 Apply multiple code fixes at once (2009-11-23)

  A new menu "Auto-fix" is now available when right clicking on an error
  message associated with a fix, allowing the user to apply fixes to multiple
  at once.

NF-45-IB10-017 Auto fix for "no space allowed" (2009-11-16)

  Messages "no space allowed" are now auto-fixed by gps.

NF-45-IB10-011 New contextual menu "Close all other editors (2009-11-17)

  When right-clicking on a notebook tab of an editor, a new contextual
  menu entry is shown, to close all other open editors

NF-45-IA23-015 Warn when assigning existing shortcut to action (2009-11-18)

  In the /Edit/Key Shortcuts dialog, a warning is now displayed when you
  try to reassign an existing key binding to another action

NF-45-IA13-016 New menu /File/Close All Editors Except Current (2009-10-14)

  This menu closes all editors except the one that currently has the focus.

NF-45-IA01-003 New plugin: selection_highlighter.py (2009-10-12)

  When some text is selected in a buffer, this plugin will automatically
  highlight other occurrences of the selected text in the buffer.

NF-45-I922-014 Fewer system calls for cross-references (2009-09-29)

  The number of system calls performed when loading the cross-reference
  information from the disk (the .ali files) has been significantly
  reduced. This results in a speed up, especially noticeable when using
  sources from a remote server.

NF-45-I810-019 Remote mode now synchronizes files upon save (2009-10-28)

  When using the GPS remote mode, locally saved files are now synchronized
  to the remote servers immediately. This allows external programs running
  on the server to immediately have access to them, and also allows faster
  sync operations before GPS launches an action on the remote server.
