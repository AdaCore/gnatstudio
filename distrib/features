New features in GPS 4.1.0
-------------------------

F130-004 Better integration with PyGTK (2006-07-17)

  If PyGTK is found at compile time, a few extra shell functions will be
  exported by GPS. In particular, this makes it possible to create widgets
  with PyGTK and include them in the GPS MDI. It is also possible to get
  the MDI contents and export it to PyGTK

New features in GPS 4.0.0
-------------------------

F615-006 Alias expansion is case insensitive (2006-06-16)

  The process of matching alias names is now case insensitive. This is
  friendlier as it allows to expand an alias no matter the alias name casing.
  This is particularly useful when the on the fly auto-casing is being used.

  Keywords: Aliases

F503-004 Block information on record/union/class (2006-05-05)

  GPS computes block information for record/union/class and has associated
  navigation actions to move to the start or the end of such block. Block
  folding is also possible which is very convenient for large records.

  Keywords: Editor, Block
