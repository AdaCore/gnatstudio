New features on 4.4.0
---------------------

NF-44-I217-007 Entities browser preserves source order (2009-02-17)

   When a record is analyzed in the entities browser, its fields are now
   displayed in the same order as in the source code

NF-44-I202-016 Support selection of multiple activities (2009-02-10)

   Actions on the VCS Activities explorer can now be done on multiple
   activities. For example, it is possible to delete or commit all selected
   activities.

NF-44-I129-010 Improved cross references loading time (2009-02-27)

   Cross references are now much more faster to load by GPS. This brings a
   significant improvement when displaying tooltips on very big projects.

NF-44-I122-033 Meaningful source editor titles (2009-02-04)

   GPS now uses more meaningful titles for source editors used to store
   version control related information: specific file revisions, file logs or
   activity logs.

NF-44-I120-054 Ability to specify font for annotation comments (2009-02-04)

   It is now possible to specify a different font for annotation comments.
   Previousely, the font for regular comments was always used for special
   comments.

NF-44-I119-037 New plug-in: tab_expansion.py (2009-01-23)

   A new optional plug-in is provided with GPS that redefines the TAB key
   in Ada source editors to generate space characters.

NF-44-I116-026 Fixing "abstract must come before new" (2009-01-19)

   An automatic fix is now proposed for "abstract must come before new" error
   messages.

NF-44-I109-036 Complete gnatpp switches in the project editor (2009-01-20)

   GPS now handles the newer gnatpp switches in the 'Pretty Print' page of the
   project editor.

NF-44-HC08-012 Support for SPARK Toolset 7.6.2 (2008-12-10)

  GPS is now compatible with version 7.6.2 of the SPARK Toolset.

NF-44-HA23-007 New menus in Edit->Selection (2008-10-23)

  The following new menus are available under Edit->Selection:
  - Move Left/Right: shift the selection one character left or right
  - Serialize: automatically increment a number in a set of adjacent lines
  - Untabify: replace tabs with spaces in the selection

NF-44-HA21-047 listvars.py plugin can show non-local variables (2009-02-02)

  This plug in shows which variables are used by a subprogram. It now provides
  a second contextual menu to show only non-local variables

NF-44-HA03-020 File changed dialog checks for diffs (2008-10-03)

  When GPS detects that a file has changed on the disk, it displays
  a dialog giving the choice between reloading the file or overriding
  it. This check now uses both the timestamp (as before) and checking
  the actual contents of the file, so that it pops up less often, in
  particular when external tools are changing the timestamps

NF-44-HA03-015 Double-clicking in breakpoint window (2008-10-03)

  It is now possible to double-click in the list of breakpoints in
  the breakpoints editor window to jump to any of these locations.

NF-44-H927-002 Speed up update VCS action (2008-10-29)

  It is now possible to disable status operation after an update.
  This speed-up the update action as status is an expensive
  operation. On slow network it can make a big difference.
  At the same time GPS has been enhanced to parse the update output
  to update file status accordingly.

NF-44-H908-010 shell.py supports colors and completion (2008-11-14)

  The shell.py plugin allows you to open a window with a system shell.
  It now supports completion (if your shell does) and colors, as well
  as being able to run more complex applications like vi

NF-44-H904-015 Minor optimization for handling VCS status (2008-12-09)

  The local file statuses where not used to override current statuses
  on the VCS explorer. It is now updating the VCS explorer as long
  as the local status won't override a remote status (Needs update or
  Needs merge).

NF-44-H707-022 Minor improvements in GNATCheck integration (2009-01-20)

  The GNATCheck rules editor menu has been renamed, and the rules editor
  now lets you choose whether you want to see the resulting file after
  exiting the editor.

NF-44-H223-004 Auto fixes for "missing string quote" (2009-02-24)

  An auto-fix is now offered for message like "missing string quote", adding
  the missing quote.

NF-44-GB03-007 Export debugger data window to png (2008-10-01)

  The debugger Data window can now be exported to png like all
  other browsers. Export to SVG is not fully supported yet.

NF-44-GA25-013 Dereferencing all items in debugger data window (2008-10-03)

  A new contextual menu is now available in boxes in the data window of
  the debugger. When you select this menu all the pointers visible in the
  box are automatically dereferenced and new boxes created appropriately.
  This is faster than clicking on each pointer in turn.

NF-44-G903-012 Call stack window cleared while running (2008-10-02)

  The debugger callstack is now cleared while the debugged program is
  running or has terminated to avoid confusion arising from an outdated
  callstack.

NF-44-G903-006 Report all style errors at once (2008-12-11)

  When running the style checkers (on files and logs) GPS will
  now report errors from all files and will not stop checking
  on the first file violating some styles.

NF-44-G510-012 Auto-fix for "use explicit pragma Pack" (2009-02-24)

  An auto-fix is now offered for message like "size for T is too small,
  use explicit pragma Pack", automatically adding a pragma Pack for the entity.

NF-44-F327-008 Auto-fix for "suggested replacement" (2009-02-24)

  An auto fix is now offered for messages like "suggested replacement",
  automatically applying the replacement suggested by the compiler.

NF-44-E817-003 Message on the VCS Explorer when no VCS defined (2008-10-27)

  When no VCS is defined on the root project and all projects it
  depends on a message is displayed into the VCS Explorer.

NF-44-DB04-011 New auto VCS mode (2008-10-27)

  The new "auto" VCS_Kind mode can be used to let GPS automatically select
  the proper external VCS. This is useful in the context where different
  people are not using the same VCS locally. For example developers
  tracking a Subversion repository using Git (git-svn module).

NF-44-DA05-006 Support for VCS without log (2008-12-23)

  It is now possible to create a VCS that do not require a log
  (logs are handled by external commands like ClearCase GUI for
  example). In this case GPS won't ask for a log file while
  doing the commit/add/remove VCS actions.

NF-44-DA05-003 VCS menus are now filtered (2008-11-03)

  The main VCS menu is filtered to contain only the VCS actions
  which are at least defined in one generic VCS. The VCS
  Activities menu is also filtered to propose actions that
  are available on the project VCS.
