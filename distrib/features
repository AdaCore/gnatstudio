New features in GPS 5.2.0 / GNATbench 2.7.0
-------------------------------------------

NF-52-L928-030 ECL: Android development supported (2012-11-08)

  GNATbench now provides an integration with the Android Development Toolkit
  (ADT) for mixed Ada-Java development. Java applications on the Android can
  invoke Ada code using interfaces automatically generated by AJIS. A
  new project type and corresponding new-project wizard are provided.

NF-52-L928-016 GPS: support for powerpc-xcoff-lynxos178 (2012-09-28)

  GPS now supports building for powerpc-lynxos178.

NF-52-L927-016 GPS: support for x86-pikeos (2012-09-27)

  GPS now supports building for the x86-pikeos architecture.

NF-52-L926-013 Ranking info for CodePeer warning messages (2012-09-26)

  The ranking information (low/medium/high) is now prepended in front of
  CodePeer warning messages in the locations view, to make it easier to
  find messages of a particular ranking.

NF-52-L919-056 GPS: Support for arm-eabi (2012-09-20)

  GPS now supports building for the arm-eabi toolchain, needed for
  the arm-elf architecture.

NF-52-L822-045 ECL: AJIS development supported (2012-10-22)

  GNATbench now provides an integration with AJIS, the high-level Ada-Java
  Interface Suite. A new project type and corresponding new-project wizard
  are provided.

NF-52-L822-044 GB: additional Pretty Printer output flexibility (2012-08-22)

  The "Pretty Print" command now allows a variety of output file settings,
  rather than unconditionally forcing a specific behavior.  A new preference
  controls the behavior, which defaults to the original behavior of replacing
  the input file with the formatted output.  If the preference is disabled,
  the behavior regarding the output file is controlled by the Pretty_Printer
  package in the project file. If that package is not defined in the project
  file or output switches are not specified, the behavior is the default
  specified by the pretty printer tool itself.

NF-52-L814-023 GB: add PDF versions of User's Guides  (2012-08-14)

  The PDF versions (A4 or letter) can be downloaded from a top-level PDF
  versions page located in the GNATbench help contents.

NF-52-L730-016 GPS: display timestamps in File Selector dialog (2012-08-02)

  The /File/Open... dialog now displays the timestamp for local files.

NF-52-L726-020 GPS: search in current project only (2012-08-16)

  A new scope has been defined to search in the currently selected project.

NF-52-L723-018 ECL: gprbuild use of cross compilers via makefiles (2012-07-23)

  GNATbench for Eclipse now directly supports the use of makefiles and gprbuild
  to invoke cross compilers.  The --target switch is passed to the makefile
  when invoked.

NF-52-L718-050 GB: Choice of Ada versions in New Project wizard  (2012-07-18)

  When using the New Project wizard to create GNATbench projects, the user can
  choose among the Ada 95, 2005, and 2012 revisions of the language.

NF-52-L716-044 ECL: makefiles can now use gprbuild (2012-07-16)

  When GNATbench for Eclipse project builds are driven by makefiles, the
  builder name is passed as a macro.  In the past this builder name was always
  passed as "gnatmake" but it can now be set to "gprbuild" instead.

NF-52-L713-003 GPS: search in run-time files (2012-09-06)

  A new scope called "Files From Runtime" is available in the search dialog
  which allows searching all spec files from the Ada run-time.

NF-52-L703-018 GB: GNAT & Ada reference manuals in GNATbench help (2012-08-02)

  Add to GNATbench help content:
    - The GNAT User's Guide & Reference Manual
    - Ada Language Reference Manuals
    - GPRbuild User's Guide

NF-52-L703-004 GB: Eclipse 3.8 and 4.2 (Juno) support (2012-07-10)

  Eclipse 3.8 and 4.2 are supported by GNATbench 2.7.0
  Note: Eclipse 3.8 requires JRE 1.6 (Java Runtime Environment).

NF-52-L702-019 GPS: Clear locations action for key shortcuts (2012-07-04)

  GPS provides a new action to assign a key shortcut to the 'Clear locations'
  capability of the Locations View.

NF-52-L614-012 GPS: Improvements to the GNATcoverage support (2012-07-24)

  Several improvements to GNATcov support have been made:
    - Modification of the Coverage preference is no longer required.
    - A new Build Mode "gnatcov" has been introduced.
    - New project attributes have been implemented to control the behavior of
      tools launched during the GNATcoverage development cycle.
    - The Coverage View is automatically reloaded after an analysis.

NF-52-L614-009 GPS: Removal of ClearCase module preference (2012-06-21)

  This preference provided access to an old version of ClearCase support,
  which has been replaced by ClearCase Native support several versions ago.
  The preference has been removed and all ClearCase users are invited to
  switch to using ClearCase Native.

NF-52-L608-027 ECL: Scenario variables are passed to makefiles (2012-06-08)

  Now when building or compiling using makefiles, existing scenario variables
  (if any) are passed to the makefile invocation so that the makefile may
  be able to reference them.

NF-52-L521-019 GPS: Minimal scrolling when jumping to a location (2012-05-21)

  When jumping between editor locations, an improved algorithm minimizes
  scrolling.  Rather than always centering the cursor on the screen, GPS now
  scrolls just enough to reveal the cursor location plus some margin.

NF-52-L514-028 GPS: Action tooltip in Locations view (2012-05-21)

  The Locations View now displays a tooltip for the action associated with a
  message.

NF-52-L509-022 GB: Viewing variables declared in packages (2012-09-12)

  When creating an expression in the debugger, the dialog is now filled with
  the qualified Ada expression for the current text.  This expression can be
  used by the underlying debugger backend.

NF-52-L503-002 GPS: improved support for C++ mangled names (2012-08-24)

  Internal support has been added for handling C++ mangled names. This
  improves response time when performing source navigation from Ada to C++
  and removes the dependency on the external tool c++filt. This new support
  requires a version of the G++ compiler from the GNAT toolset later than
  2012-06-23.

NF-52-L502-025 GB: New preference to skip parsing Ada runtime (2012-06-25)

  GNATbench now has a preference to inhibit Ada runtime parsing for
  code assist functionality.  This greatly reduces the overall time spent
  on parsing when the IDE is launched.

NF-52-L426-037 GB: remove trailing blanks when saving an Ada file (2012-08-14)

  A new preference, "Remove trailing spaces when saving," has been added
  to the Ada Editor preference page.  This preference may be set to "Never,"
  "Autodetect," and "Always."  "Never" and "Always" are obvious.  "Autodetect"
  directs the IDE to remove trailing blanks only if the file had zero trailing
  blanks when it was initially loaded.

NF-52-L416-043 GB: Improved search results interaction (2012-04-16)

  In search results, when a non-nested entry is selected, the IDE opens an
  editor on the first enclosed match, rather than on the enclosing construct
  itself.  For example, let's say the search finds one more more references
  to an entity within a subprogram.  Only one entry, the subprogram name, will
  appear in the results, rather than every enclosed match being given an entry.
  Selecting that subprogram entry will open the editor at the first enclosed
  reference, rather than at the subprogram name.

NF-52-L416-019 GPS: improve batch codefix support (2012-05-03)

  GPS now provides the ability to automatically fix similar errors in batch
  mode when multiple choices are available.

NF-52-L405-002 GPS: experimental Mercurial plugin (2012-07-17)

  Experimental support for the Mercurial VCS has been added to GPS.

NF-52-L329-026 GPS: Improved Emacs selection mode support (2012-03-30)

  When in Emacs mode, after setting a mark, the commands to go to the
  beginning and end of line will extend the selection.

NF-52-L329-021 GPS: isearch.py stores result of ctrl-w in history (2012-03-29)

  When you start a search (ctrl-s) and then use ctrl-w to copy parts of the
  current identifier as the search pattern, this pattern is now stored
  immediately in the history.  That way, cancelling the search and restarting
  it with ctrl-s ctrl-s will search what was copied.  (We used to update the
  pattern only after you pressed ctrl-s a second time after ctrl-w.)
  This is closer to Emacs' behavior.

NF-52-L327-003 GPS: displaying metrics in GPS (2012-05-17)

  It is now possible to open the Metrics view using the Tools->View->Metrics
  menu item.

NF-52-L320-004 GPS: simplify Default Builder preference (2012-03-20)

  The Default Builder preference has been simplified, with the following
  changes to the settings:

    - 'Gprmake' has been removed, since gprmake is no longer supported
    - 'Gprbuild' has been renamed 'Auto', which is a more accurate description
    - 'Gprbuild_Always' has been renamed 'Gprbuild', for consistency with the
      'Gnatmake' setting.

  Note that if you were using a non-default setting for this preference, you
  will need to reset it manually.

NF-52-L227-030 GB: project names need not be legal Ada identifiers (2012-03-09)

  The name of an Eclipse/Workbench project need not conform to the rules for
  Ada identifiers.  This change applies to both new projects as well as
  existing Eclipse/Workbench projects to be converted to GNATbench use.

NF-52-L213-028 GPS: new command GPS.EditorLocation.inside_word (2012-02-13)

  A new GPS shell/Python command is available to determine whether a location
  is inside a word.  This is useful when creating editor plugins.

NF-52-L211-002 GPS: wildcard support in Open From Project (2012-04-09)

  Interpretation of wildcard characters is now available in the
  "Open From Project..." dialog.

NF-52-L124-025 GPS: improvements in auto_highlight_occurrences.py (2012-02-16)

  There are two new features in the auto_highlight_occurrences.py plugin:
    - if there is a selection, other occurrences of the selected text
      will be highlighted in the editor
    - if the cursor is on a word which is not a navigable entity (for instance
      keywords, words in comments, or in languages other than Ada or C), GPS
      will perform text-based highlighting of this word

  Both of these behaviors can be deactivated through the Preferences dialog,
  under Plugins->auto_highlight_occurrences.

NF-52-L120-062 GB: set actual name of main in debug config (2012-05-16)

  Newly created debug configurations now set the default breakpoint to the
  procedure of the main executable, rather than simply "main".

NF-52-L118-005 ECL: Removal policy when fixing code (2012-01-24)

    The preference "Removal policy when fixing code" has been added to the Ada
    "General" preference page.  It defines the way code should be altered when
    sections of code are to be removed.
    - "Always_Remove" means that the code will be removed by GNATbench.
    - "Always_Comment" means that the code will always be commented out.
    - "Propose_Both_Choices" will propose a menu with both choices.

NF-52-L109-019 GPS: goto next/previous bookmark (2012-01-23)

  Two new actions ("Goto Next Bookmark" and "Goto Previous Bookmark") are now
  available to jump to the nearest next or previous bookmark in the current
  file.  These actions can be bound to keys in the "General" section of the
  Key Shortcuts dialog.

NF-52-L109-016 GPS: New action "Delete Line" (2012-01-11)

  This action deletes the current line and places the cursor on the beginning
  of the following line.  It can be bound to a key in the "Editor" section of
  the Key Shortcuts dialog.

NF-52-L101-003 GB: display task info in debug view (2012-01-10)

  Ada task information is now displayed in the debug view.  This feature can
  be enabled/disabled from the debug view menu.

  GPS is now licensed under the terms of the GPL version 3.

NF-52-KC07-036 GPS: doc converted to sphinx (2011-12-08)

  The documentation format was changed, so that we can produce nicer-
  looking output.  In addition, the new format provides an integrated
  search feature over all pages of the manual.

NF-52-KB10-053 GB: support for relative path outside workspace (2011-12-06)

  In GNATbench properties, it is now possible to use a relative path to a
  GNAT project file located outside the workspace.

NF-52-KA28-027 GPS: new Editor action "toggle wrapping" (2011-10-28)

  A new action "toggle wrapping" is defined in the plugin text_utils.py,
  and can be associated to a key binding in the Key Shortcuts editor to
  conveniently switch between no wrapping and word wrapping in the current
  editor.

NF-52-KA27-013 GPS: improved C/C++ smart completion (2012-05-20)

  We have added support within GPS for analyzing the context and providing
  better proposals for smart completion of C/C++ entities, including cases
  like: x.field, x->field, x.method, x->method, x[...][...]->field,
  x[...][...]->method, and class::method.

  GPS also proposes smart completion of parameters in function and method
  calls.  The names of the formals are added as C comments to facilitate adding
  the actuals.  For example: "obj.copy (/* target */  , /* source */  )"

NF-52-KA03-005 GPS: force use of gprbuild (2011-12-06)

  It's possible now to always use gprbuild as a builder for projects, whether
  or not these projects are multi-language.  This is done via the new
  preference "Default builder," using the "Gprbuild_Always" setting.  This
  preference replaces the previous "Multi language builder" preference.

NF-52-K907-014 GPS: Navigation from Ada to C++ (2011-10-26)

  It is now possible to navigate from Ada sources to entities imported
  from C++.

NF-52-K830-016 ECL: improved builder support (2012-08-08)

  It is now possible to customize the commands that are used when
  compiling, building, or cleaning projects or files, using the Ada
  "Builder Targets" preference page.

  When customizing the Ada perspective, you may add builder toobar buttons
  which enable the "GNATbench Build Toolbar Menus" command group.

  A build mode chooser (checks/debug/default/gcov/gprof/optimize) is also
  available in "GNATbench Build Toolbar Menus."

NF-52-K726-023 ECL: Specific "Build Main" menu for each Main file (2012-07-17)

  All units containing an application entry point appear in the Project's
  "Build Main" menu.

NF-52-K401-026 Quick fix alternative for unreferenced objects (2011-10-31)

  Two alternatives are now suggested to "quick fix" an unreferenced object:
  the user may remove the object declaration, or add a pragma Unreferenced.

NF-52-K227-005 GB: Put AdaCore icon on About Eclipse SDK panel (2012-01-05)

  The AdaCore icon is now displayed in the About box and links to the
  installed GNATbench features.

NF-52-K225-019 Improved indentation of comments within expressions (2012-02-20)

  Indentation of comments within expressions or as part of continuation lines
  will take the extra continuation line preference into account.

NF-52-K223-024 ECL: support for gprbuild (2012-08-07)

  GNATbench for Eclipse now directly supports use of gprbuild in addition
  to gnatmake when building.  Selection of the builder may be made via Ada
  "General" preferences.  The preferences are to: always use gprbuild,
  always use gnatmake, or automatically select the builder on a per-project
  basis.  Automatic selection is based upon whether multiple languages are
  specified in the GNAT project file.

NF-52-K223-021 GPS: Automatic removal of Subversion errors (2011-10-28)

  Errors emitted by Subversion are removed from the Locations view when the
  file containing errors is successfully committed or reverted.

NF-52-K129-003 GPS: drag'n'drop support on linux (2012-06-12)

  Under Linux, you can drag and drop a file from the explorer or desktop
  to the GPS window to open it.

NF-52-K121-030 GPS: Codefix support for unrequired out-mode (2011-10-21)

  Added support to automatically fix source code for which the GNAT compiler
  ouputs warnings regarding in-out formal parameters.

  blank lines at end of file when saving editors.

NF-52-JA26-020 Improved indentation in parenthesized expressions (2012-02-20)

  Automatic indentation of 'or else' and 'and then' constructs at the end of
  lines inside parenthesized expressions has been improved.  In particular,
  they no longer generate an extra indentation on the next line.

NF-52-IA30-015 GPS: new menu to hide globals from outline view (2012-08-09)

  Visibility of global objects in the Outline View is now configurable via
  a contextual menu.

NF-52-I527-048 GPS: multi-line option in MDI.input_dialog (2012-02-01)

  attaching to a running process, and post-mortem debugging.

NF-52-HC11-001 GPS: add "Clear messages" to messages context menu (2012-05-10)

  The contextual menu for the messages window is now customizable through
  plugins, and a "Clear messages" item has been added.

NF-52-H725-016 GPS: "at line" locations are recognized (2012-09-12)

  GPS now understands tool output messages that communicate secondary locations
  using an "at line" format.  These locations are shown in the Locations view
  for quick navigation.

NF-52-G917-017 GPS: Coverage Report accessible through Back button (2012-02-02)

  When clicking on a file or subprogram in the Code Coverage report, GPS opens
  this location in an editor.  It is now possible to click the "Back" button
  in the toolbar to go back to the Code Coverage report.

NF-52-G704-018 GPS: display of elaboration circuitries (2012-08-07)

  GPS now displays as a graph the elaboration circuitries detected
  by gnatbind at compile time.

  The replacement may contain the special escapes \0 through \9 to refer
  to the corresponding matching text and sub-expressions if the search is
  done in regexp mode.

NF-52-G507-003 GPS: automatic mode for "strip blanks" preference (2012-04-24)

  A new mode "Autodetect" has been added to the "strip blanks" preference.
  In this mode, if a file is open and contains zero trailing blanks, GPS
  will automatically strip trailing blanks when saving that file.  Otherwise,
  trailing blanks will be preserved.

NF-52-FB01-013 ECL: Missing right-click debug options in editor (2011-10-12)

  The Ada editor now supports debug context menu items for "run to line,"
  "move to line," "resume at line," and "add watch expression."  The Ada editor
  ruler context menu items "toggle breakpoint," "enabled/disable breakpoint,"
  and "breakpoint properties" have also been added.

NF-52-F831-008 GPS: inherit ALI parser for custom language (2012-04-12)
