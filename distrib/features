New features in GPS 4.3.0
-------------------------

NF-43-H111-019 Smarter activity menu for adding/removing files (2008-01-13)

  When a file is already into an activity GPS now proposes a menu to
  remove it from this activity on the VCS Contextual menu.

NF-43-GC19-021 New plug-in to reset GPS Windows registry settings (2008-01-30)

  A new plug-in has been added to reset the Windows registry settings for
  GPS. Those settings are to associate some specific extensions like .ads,
  .adb, .gpr to GPS. It can be the case that installing another application
  breaks those default settings. By running this new plug-in (Help/Reset
  Registry) all the values are restored to their GPS default values.

NF-43-GC12-017 Align on arrows working in case statement (2007-12-29)

  The align plug-in has been enhanced to support arrows inside
  case statement.

NF-43-GC09-009 Add new action to center a line of text (2007-12-10)

  A new Python action to center a line has been added into the
  text_utils.py library. This action can also center a text inside a
  comment line.

NF-43-GC06-020 Add minimal Git VCS support (2007-12-09)

  Add Git support in GPS VCS. This is only a minimal support as Git is
  very different VCS than CVS or Subversion for example. It is
  possible to query status, ask for a difference with HEAD and
  retrieve the log information.

NF-43-GB30-007 Completion for protected fields (2007-12-11)

  Completion on protected objects fields are now proposed by the smart complete
  command.

NF-43-GB27-021 Command line pretty printer using GPS reformating (2007-11-28)

  An new python example demonstrates how to reformat all sources of a project
  with a single command line. The result is the same as opening each source
  file of the project, selecting the whole buffer and executing the
  "Format Selection" action (bound to Control-Tab by default). This example
  is named reformat_project.py and the usage is detailed in the file itself.

NF-43-GB22-016 New menu to reformat a selection (2007-11-28)

  An new menu /Edit/Format Selection has been added in order to be able to
  reformat the current selection. This capability used to be accessible only
  from a key binding (set through the key shortcut editor) which will remain
  control-tab by default.

NF-43-GB14-004 New VCS action to prepare group commit in one click (2007-11-17)

  The new VCS action "Commit as new Activity" has been implemented to simplify
  simple group-commit activity. Calling this action will create an anonymous
  activity, populate it with all selected files from the VCS Explorer and
  open the activity log file. Just fill it and commit the activity.

NF-43-GB07-006 Major speed up in project view (2007-11-26)

  The computation time for the project view was greatly improved, and the
  view displays much faster now on big projects.

NF-43-FC10-002 Code fixing uses the real indentation (2007-12-17)

  When the compiler detects an intendation problem, and doesn't propose the
  actual expected column, the auto fix proposed by GPS is now more accurate, 
  using the same indentation engine & preferences as the editor.
