NF-52-L124-025 GPS: improvements in auto_highlight_occurrences.py (2012-02-16)

  The plugin auto_highlight_occurrences.py has two new features:

      will be highlighted in the editor
    - if the cursor is on a word which is not a navigable entity (for instance
      keywords, words in comments, or in languages other than Ada or C), GPS

  Both of these behaviors can be deactivated through the Preferences dialog,
