New features in GPS 6.0.0 / GNATbench 2.8.0
-------------------------------------------

NF-53-M204-035 ECL: automatic scenario set for Android projects (2013-02-04)

  When the new-project wizard creates a new Ada for Android project
  the "OS" scenario variable will be set to "linux" automatically.
  This setting is essential for creating proper library names for subsequent
  use by the Android OS.

NF-53-M129-023 GPS: cleanup of CodePeer report (2013-03-11)

  CodePeer report was changed to improve usability.

NF-53-M129-002 GPS: return block completion (2013-02-04)

  Add "return ... end return;" statement support for complete block
  completion

NF-60-M122-025 GPS: filter in the outline view (2013-01-23)

  A filter has been added to the Outline view to make it easier to find
  entities.

NF-60-M121-011 GPS: Outline has a flat view mode (2013-01-21)

  It is now possible to display all entities at the same level, rather than
  nested hierarchically. In some cases, it makes searching for an entity
  easier.

NF-60-M111-033 GPS: Refill automatically computes paragraph (2013-01-11)

  The menu /Edit/Selection/Refill will now either apply to the current
  selection if it exists (as before), or automatically compute the extents
  of the current paragraph to reformat (instead of only applying to the
  current line).

NF-60-M110-025 GPS: group spec and body in Outline view (2013-01-10)

  It is now possible to group the spec and body (or spec and full view) for an
  entity on the same row in the Outline view, to restrict the total height of
  the Outline view. Clicking on the name of the entity will jump to its spec,
  but if this is already the current location in the editor will jump to its
  body instead.

NF-53-M109-036 GPS: autofix on missing constant with preferences (2013-01-21)

  Autofix has always done fixes in lowercases. This enhancement performs
  the fixes on missing constants following the user defined preferences
  specified in Preferences/Editor/Ada/Reserved word casing

NF-60-M108-041 GPS: line wrapping in Messages window (2013-01-09)

  It is now possible to configure whether the Messages window should wrap
  lines, or require horizontal scrolling.

NF-53-M102-006 GPS: move Serialize to /Edit/Rectangle/ (2013-01-11)

  This menu was previously in /Edit/Selection, but is more logical in the
  Rectangle submenu since it conceptually applies to a rectangle.

NF-60-LC21-017 GPS: Update to Scenario View (2013-01-08)

  The Scenario view has been updated to a more usable tree rendering.

NF-60-LC06-024 GPS: Locations view has a toolbar (2012-12-06)

  Actions such as "clear locations", or the filter panel were now moved into
  that toolbar to make them more accessible. The preference "Auto Jump To First
  Location" was removed from the preferences menu and moved to the toolbar as
  well.

NF-60-LC06-015 GPS: tab menu allows easy selection of open tabs (2012-12-17)

  The right-click menu on notebook tabs now shows the list of all windows open
  in that tabs, to ease navigation.

NF-60-LC03-011 GPS: local toolbars for views (2012-12-03)

  A number of views now have a local toolbar. They also display their
  configuration settings in a local menu rather than in the Preferences
  dialog or the contextual menu.

NF-60-LB29-021 GPS: remove status bar (2012-11-29)

  The status bar has been removed. It was only used to display the current
  tasks in progress, and the corresponding progress bars were moved to the
  right of the toolbar, replacing the throbber.

NF-60-LB29-006 GPS: use ellipsis in window titles (2012-11-28)

  The text in the title bars and in the notebook tabs will now use ellipsis
  ("...") when the window is too small to accomodate the whole text. The size
  of notebook tabs is also limited so that we do not end up with a single tab
  using most of the notebook widths, thus hidding the others. This behavior
  is controlled by a new preference Window/Homogeneous Tabs.

NF-60-LB26-025 GPS: clickable qualified name in editor status bars (2012-12-13)

  The name of the current subprogram, as displayed in the editors status bars,
  now includes the name of the enclosing subprograms and packages. Each of
  these names is clickable to easily jump to the beginning of the enclosing
  block.

NF-53-LB20-022 GPS: Key shortcuts dialog display improved (2012-11-21)

  The display of the key shortcuts in this dialog now matches what is
  done for the toplevel menus, using symbols like up arrow for the shift
  key, a caret sign for the control key, and the special symbols for
  Mac keyboards.

NF-53-LB15-037 GPS: EditorOverlay can now highlight a whole line (2012-12-05)

  The EditorOverlay class can now be used in Python plugins to highlight an
  entire line, through the property "paragraph-background":
    # Create an overlay for an editor:
    b = GPS.EditorBuffer.get(GPS.File ("my_file.adb"))
    o = b.create_overlay("my_overlay_name")

    # Set the paragraph-background property to pink
    o.set_property ("paragraph-background", "#f0c0c0")

    # This highlights the entire line 317 in my file
    b.apply_overlay (o,
       GPS.EditorLocation(b, 317, 1),
       GPS.EditorLocation(b, 317, 1))

NF-53-LB04-004 GB: Export GNATbench preferences like CDT (2013-01-22)

  GNATbench preferences can now be exported via the export preferences wizard
  and imported into another workspace via the import preferences wizard.

NF-53-L926-027 GPS: Project, Files and Windows views pop-ups (2012-11-13)

  Tooltips added to views to help navigation when windows are narrow.

NF-53-L921-032 GPS: Show protected objects in Outline view (2012-10-16)

  Protected and task types/objects and their entries are now visible in
  Outline View. New filter in Outline View "Show tasks, entries, and protected
  types" is used to show/hide these items.

NF-53-L530-025 New cross-reference engine based on sqlite (2013-01-24)

   GPS and GNATbench both have a new xref engine, based on sqlite. This new
   engine is expected to bring extra performance (since the xref database
   becomes persistent across sessions and GPS will no longer need to parse ALI
   files on the fly), as well as more stability (by using an external process
   to fill the database, and relying on sqlite's very good stability).
   This engine is currently disabled by default, but can be enabled by adding
   a line "ENTITIES.SQLITES=yes" in $HOME/.gps/traces.cfg .

NF-53-J728-022 GPS: the Project Wizard takes advantage of gnatname (2012-11-08)

  The project wizard now optionally uses gnatname to search for Ada units in
  files with non-standard naming conventions.

NF-53-I320-015 GB: Enhance block completions (2013-01-25)

  The block completion facility has been extended to cover additional
  constructs e.g. extended return statement, protected entry bodies,
  variant parts inside record declarations.
