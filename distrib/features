GB14-004 New VCS action to prepare in one-click a group-commit  (2007-11-17)

  The new VCS action "Commit as new Activity" has been implemented to
  simplify simple group-commit activity. Calling this action will
  create an anonymous activity, will populate it with all selected
  files from the VCS Explorer and will open the activity log
  file. Just fill it and commit the activity.
