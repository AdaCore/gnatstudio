New features in GPS 3.1.0

- E404-002 The current location is saved when the user selects Goto Line,
  does a search, or jumps to a location through the Outline View or Locations
  Window. This way, it is easier to navigate back to the previous position

- BA07-005 Improved cross-references for generics
  From a reference to an entity declared in a generic, it is now possible to
  find out what instantiation of the generic is involved.

- Identifier completion is now case insensitive when the language itself is
  case insensitive.

- Improved handling of tooltips in editors
  Tooltip now remains displayed while the mouse cursor stays on the hotspot
  word. Using the mousewheel to scroll now hides the tooltip.
