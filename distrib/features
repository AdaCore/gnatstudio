New features in GPS 6.1.0 / GNATbench 2.9.0
-------------------------------------------

NF-61-MC17-032 GPS: Improved auto-align end of line comments (2013-12-17)

  Align end of line comments now ignores comments that don't have code before
  them.

NF-61-MC02-033 GPS: Minor enhancements to the tip-of-the-day (2013-12-02)

  The "tip of the day" dialog can now be moved, and the text for the
  documentation can be selected.

NF-61-MB26-054 GPS: New line number display preference (2013-11-27)

  The "Display line numbers" preference now settings Never, Some_Lines,
  All_Lines. The new Some_Lines option displays every fifth line number,
  reducing visual clutter and making the source code stand out more.

NF-61-MB13-030 GPS: Use a fallback by name for cross references (2013-11-14)

  The GPS cross reference engine will now use imprecise information from the
  completion engine to find the origin of an entity, so that it is able to
  resolve an entity by name, even when this entity is not visible in the
  lexical closure of the user's code

NF-61-MA25-032 GPS: Use the primary modifier for shortcuts (2013-10-29)

  GPS now uses the primary system modifier key instead of the fixed control
  key for its default key shortcuts. This has only effects on OSX, where this
  modifier is mapped to the command key.

NF-61-MA22-042 GPS: Recompute Xrefs on file save (2013-10-29)

  GPS now recomputes the cross references of a given file every time this file
  is saved. This enhances the quality of all tools relying on the cross
  references engine - refactorings, code navigation, occurences highlighting,
  etc.

NF-61-MA21-056 GPS: Autofix to current file only (2013-11-05)

  Autofix menu was extended with items to restrict fixing of simple errors and
  warnings to current file occurencies.

NF-61-MA18-041 GPS: Menus described in menus.xml (2013-11-13)

  GPS now describes its menu layout in an external file, which can be used
  to reorder menus or even hide some of them.

NF-61-MA18-018 GPS: New plug-in vim.py (2013-10-18)

  GPS now has a vim emulation layer, that aims to reproduce the behavior of the
  vim text editor in GPS editor buffers. It will be enabled by default in all
  buffers if you activate it via the plug-ins dialog.

NF-61-MA07-059 GPS: Copy/Paste operations using multi-cursors (2013-11-29)

  When multiple selections are active, it is possible to cut, copy, and paste
  with multiple cursors. If the copy buffer has been filled with the same
  cursors, then the content of each individual cursor will be pasted. If the
  buffer was filled with only the main cursor, or with other cursors in a
  precedent operation, the content of the main buffer will be replicated on
  every cursor's location. Cut and copy works as you would expect.
  Multi-cursors buffers are ignored in the context of other applications, or
  when there are no multi cursors active.

NF-61-MA07-049 GPS: Multi selection using multi-cursors (2013-11-29)

  When multiple cursors are active, it is now possible to select simultaneously
  with all cursors as you would with one.

NF-61-MA04-035 GPS: remove busy cursor (2013-11-22)

  GPS no longer uses a "busy" cursor when it is doing long operations,
  since this is better replaced by the main progress bar. A busy cursor is
  typically hard to aim. The corresponding python API GPS.set_busy,
  GPS.unset_busy and GPS.get_busy have been removed.

NF-61-M722-010 GPS: Bind goto next/previous location to Alt+Arrows (2013-12-12)

  Goto next location is now bound to Alt+Right and Goto previous location is
  now bound to Alt+Left. This is meant to mimic the behaviour of numerous
  modern applications, most notably popular web browsers, have for navigating
  the history.

NF-61-M108-043 GPS: Highlight custom patterns in Messages View (2013-12-02)

   The Message View highlights text according to user defined regular
   expressions and colors.

NF-61-LC05-020 GPS: Open shell from icons in Project View (2013-11-07)

  Shell plugin extends contextual menu to lauch shell from Project View and
  others contexts where directory information available.

NF-61-LB30-034 GPS: Faster Ways to Open and Navigate GPR files (2013-10-21)

  New action "Edit project source file" provides fastest way to open the source
  of current project in GPS editor.

NF-61-KA19-010 GPS: Integrate GNATcoverage detailed messages (2013-11-13)

  The GNATcoverage plug-in in GPS can now get the detailed coverage messages
  for each line and display them in the location window. These messages can
  also be displayed inside the corresponding editors by clicking on the
  coverage status margin.
