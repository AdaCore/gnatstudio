New features in GPS 4.3.0
-------------------------

NF-43-H502-016 New action to compare version N and N-1 (2008-05-08)

  In the Revision View it is now possible to compare any revision with the
  previous one.

NF-43-H401-006 Support for the arm-nucleus toolchain (2008-04-08)

  Support for the GNAT arm-mentor-nucleus toolchain is now available by
  default in the project properties.

NF-43-H306-005 Support for PPC assembly highlighting (2008-03-07)

  An optional plug-in (ppc.xml) is provided in the GPS library which provides
  the ability to highlight PPC assembly code (in particular branches and
  labels) in the source editor and outline view.

NF-43-H306-004 Switch editor pages can hide command line (2008-03-28)

  When you define a new tool in XML, along with its switches, you can now
  indicate that the command line of the tool should not be displayed in the
  project editor (only the buttons to edit the switches)

NF-43-H226-031 Support for -eL gnatmake/gprbuild switch (2008-02-27)

  When the 'Fast Project Loading' preference is enabled, GPS will now
  automatically call gnatmake, gnatclean, gprclean and gprbuild with the
  -eL switch. Note that for gnatclean and gprclean, this requires a recent
  version of these tools.

NF-43-H226-019 Improved interface for code completion (2008-02-27)

  Smart completion now completes the currently highlighted word when receiving
  a character which does not belong to an identifier (for instance dot,
  colon, semi-colon, etc).

NF-43-H216-003 gprbuild no longer packaged with GPS (2008-02-19)

  GPS binary distributions no longer come with gprbuild, to avoid
  confusion with existing gprbuild versions, packaged with GNAT.
  For users of older versions of GNAT, it is also possible/recommended
  to install gprbuild from a standalone package.

NF-43-H123-034 Cross-references and extending projects (2008-01-31)

  If a source file is overridden in an extending project, but has not been
  recompiled locally, GPS will try to use the xref information from the
  extended project to provide cross-referencing in the file.

NF-43-H121-010 Menu Build->Check Semantic (2008-02-18)

  A new menu Build->Check Semantic is provided, similar to Build->Check Syntax
  to check for semantic errors in a given Ada source file.

NF-43-H111-019 Smarter activity menu for adding/removing files (2008-01-13)

  When a file is already into an activity GPS now proposes a menu to
  remove it from this activity on the VCS Contextual menu.

NF-43-H110-009 Improved indentation of "raise with" (2008-02-20)

  The Ada 2005 construct "raise Exception with msg" is now better indented,
  in particular when a line break is added as part of this construct.

NF-43-GC19-021 New plug-in to reset GPS Windows registry settings (2008-01-30)

  A new plug-in has been added to reset the Windows registry settings for
  GPS. Those settings are to associate some specific extensions like .ads,
  .adb, .gpr to GPS. It can be the case that installing another application
  breaks those default settings. By running this new plug-in (Help/Reset
  Registry) all the values are restored to their GPS default values.

NF-43-GC12-017 Align on arrows working in case statement (2007-12-29)

  The align plug-in has been enhanced to support arrows inside
  case statement.

NF-43-GC09-009 Add new action to center a line of text (2007-12-10)

  A new Python action to center a line has been added into the
  text_utils.py library. This action can also center a text inside a
  comment line.

NF-43-GC06-020 Add minimal Git VCS support (2007-12-09)

  Add Git support in GPS VCS. This is only a minimal support as Git is
  very different VCS than CVS or Subversion for example. It is
  possible to query status, ask for a difference with HEAD and
  retrieve the log information.

NF-43-GB30-007 Completion for protected fields (2007-12-11)

  Completion on protected objects fields are now proposed by the smart complete
  command.

NF-43-GB29-015 Project files searched for on ADA_PROJECT_PATH (2008-03-27)

  If you specify a -P command line parameter to gps, the specified project is
  searched, as usual, in the current directory, and if not found in the
  directories specified by the ADA_PROJECT_PATH and GPR_PROJECT_PATH
  variables.

NF-43-GB27-021 Command line pretty printer using GPS reformating (2007-11-28)

  An new python example demonstrates how to reformat all sources of a project
  with a single command line. The result is the same as opening each source
  file of the project, selecting the whole buffer and executing the
  "Format Selection" action (bound to Control-Tab by default). This example
  is named reformat_project.py and the usage is detailed in the file itself.

NF-43-GB22-016 New menu to reformat a selection (2007-11-28)

  An new menu /Edit/Format Selection has been added in order to be able to
  reformat the current selection. This capability used to be accessible only
  from a key binding (set through the key shortcut editor) which will remain
  control-tab by default.

NF-43-GB15-003 New plugin: create_missing_dirs.py (2008-03-27)

  This plugin, contributed by a GPS user, creates missing directories when
  a project is loaded.

NF-43-GB14-004 New VCS action to prepare group commit in one click (2007-11-17)

  The new VCS action "Commit as new Activity" has been implemented to simplify
  simple group-commit activity. Calling this action will create an anonymous
  activity, populate it with all selected files from the VCS Explorer and
  open the activity log file. Just fill it and commit the activity.

NF-43-GB07-006 Major speed up in project view (2007-11-26)

  The computation time for the project view was greatly improved, and the
  view displays much faster now on big projects.

NF-43-GA26-017 Improved handling of dispatching calls (2008-02-19)

  GPS now handles by default dispatching calls in contextual menus, and if
  there are several primitive operations corresponding to a dispatching call,
  will display a submenu for "goto declaration/body" entries.
  Previousely, this capability was disabled by default, and when enabled
  manually, a submenu was always created for dispatching calls, even when only
  one primitive operation existed.

NF-43-GA19-017 Support for annotated comments highlighting (2008-02-29)

  The Ada source editor will now highlight with a different color annotated
  comments (e.g. --#).

NF-43-G417-014 Improved editing for gpr files (2008-02-21)

  GPS now recognizes gpr specific keywords (e.g. project, external) when
  editing, in particular when performing automatic casing.

NF-43-FC10-002 Code fixing uses the real indentation (2007-12-17)

  When the compiler detects an intendation problem, and doesn't propose the
  actual expected column, the auto fix proposed by GPS is now more accurate,
  using the same indentation engine & preferences as the editor.

NF-43-D811-007 Ability to define new language categories (2008-03-12)

  It is now possible in XML files to define new language categories, visible
  in the project and outline views.

NF-43-D630-005 Ability to select the run directory (2008-02-21)

  GPS now provides the ability to choose between the executable directory
  of a program and the current directory to run or debug an application.
