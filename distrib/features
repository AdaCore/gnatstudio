EC29-004 GPS Activities improvement (2006-01-04)

  A VCS activity is now closed if all the files have been properly committed.
  Files part of a committed (or closed) activity can be assigned to another
  activity. It is only possible to delete a committed activity, all other
  actions are disabled.

  Keywords: VCS

EB30-005 Saving the contents of the Data Window (2005-11-30)

  Whenever you close the debugger data window (for instance when the debugger
  is terminated, or manually during a debug session), its contents is now
  preserved, so that if you reopen the data window, it displays the same boxes.

  Keywords: Debugger

EB29-004 Editing project with no sources

  When you open a project that contains no sources for one of its languages,
  a warning is displayed in the Messages window. Editing the project properties
  of this project no longer displays an intermediate dialog warning you about
  potential errors in the project

  Keywords: Project

EB25-007 Full shell/python interface for accessing the debugger (2005-11-25)

  A new set of constructors and methods are available to create, access
  and send commands to the debugger. See the GPS.Debugger class
  documentation for more details.

  Keywords: Debugger, Python

EB23-004 New attribute in Project Properties: externally_built (2005-11-24)

  The "externally_built" project attribute can now be set/modified
  graphically in the project properties editor.

  Keywords: Project

EB21-015 VCS Explorer redesign (2005-12-28)

  The VCS Explorer has been completely redesigned. The new version displays
  the status in a project hierarchy instead of a flat view. The status are
  now always added into the explorer instead of replacing the current ones.
  A set of actions, in the VCS contextual menu, have been added to help manage
  this new explorer. Also, files edited in GPS are automatically added into
  the explorer with the Modified status. This helps finding which files have
  been changed during a GPS session.

EB21-009 Debugger windows not saved in the desktop (2005-11-30)

  If you save the desktop while a debugger is running, the saved desktop now
  includes the debugger windows (consoles, call stack, data window). They will
  be correctly restored the next time the desktop is loaded.

  Keywords: Debugger, Desktop

EB18-009 Status column in the Task Manager was removed (2005-12-01)

  This column wasn't showing useful additional data not already visible in the
  progress bar, and was removed to save screen space

  Keywords: Task Manager

EB18-006 Size & position of GPS window specific to each project (2005-11-18)

  The size of the GPS main window is now saved as part of each project
  saved. Thus the default desktop can use a size other than the one you
  use when developing particular projects.

  Keywords: Desktop

EB17-011 Possibility to modify the default desktop for all users (2005-11-18)

  The default desktop can now be found under <prefix>/share/gps/desktop.xml
  and be modified manually.

  Keywords: Desktop

EA18-018 Default desktop no longer saved automatically (2005-11-18)

  The default desktop is now never saved automatically, which allows
  you to define it once and for all, and keep the automatic saving of
  desktops for project-specific desktops.

  Keywords: Desktop

EA14-023 Scenario View back in the default desktop (2005-11-18)

  The scenario view which was removed from the default desktop in
  previous releases is displayed again by default.

  the redundant use clause.

E512-008 Saving breakpoints between sessions (2005-11-29)

  A new preference was added that indicates whether debugger breakpoints should
  be saved between debugger sessions. If activated, the breakpoints will be
  automatically set when the same executable is debugged again.

  Keywords: Debugger
