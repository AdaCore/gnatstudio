New features in GPS 17.0 / GNATbench 17.0
-----------------------------------------

NF-170-OB05-010 GPS: remove the Always Use External Editor pref (2015-11-06)

  This preference (which always uses an external editor rather than GPS's
  own editor) has been removed. Such editors do not conveniently give access
  to cross-references, outline, and all the other facilities provided by GPS

NF-170-OA29-048 GPS: collapse all project nodes in Project view (2015-11-02)

  A new button was added to the local toolbar of the Project view, to
  collapse all project nodes. This is a way to quickly cleanup the display
  after using "Locate in Project View" for a while.

NF-170-O314-006 GPS: saving project before opening it's source (2015-11-05)

  Edit-source button in project properties rewrites project's
  file (with user's confirmation) before opening it in editor.
  This closes the dialog.
