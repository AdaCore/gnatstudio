New features in GPS 17.0 / GNATbench 17.0
-----------------------------------------

NF-170-OC17-020 GPS: OS shell emits stty command automatically (2015-12-22)

  The "OS Shell" window sometimes need a "stty echo" command to properly
  display the keys typed on the keyboard. GPS now has a preference to
  automatically emit this command. The new shell also has a GPSSHELL
  environment variable set automatically, so that you can test it in your
  shell's configuration files to enable or disable specific behaviors.

NF-170-OC02-030 GB: trailing space removal set to autodetect (2015-12-04)

  The default value of the "remove trailing spaces when saving" feature is set
  to Autodetect. When editing new files and Autodetect mode is selected, the
  trailing spaces are removed. In this mode they are preserved only if
  trailing spaces were detected in the file content when the file was opened.

NF-170-OB17-034 GPS: new calculator support in omni-search (2015-11-17)

  It is now possible to type simple mathematical expression in the
  omnisearch ("2 + 3**2") to get their result in decimal, hexadecimal
  and binary.

NF-170-OB16-046 GPS: Ellipsis in Project view (2015-11-17)

  A new setting in the local menu of the Project view can be activated to
  ellipsize the long file names. A file would thus be displayed as
  "...long.adb" if the project view is not wide enough to fit the whole name.

NF-170-OB13-048 GPS: GPS.Menu no longer derives from GPS.GUI (2015-11-16)

  A menu no longer is necessarily a graphical object (it could be displayed
  outside of the application on some systems like Ubuntu or OSX), so this
  inheritance has been removed. Most functions have been reimplemented though
  using the action associated with the menu. Only pywidget() is no longer
  available.
  The function GPS.Menu.rename() is no longer provided. Instead, destroy the
  menu and create a new one associated with the same action.

NF-170-OB13-034 GPS: remove support for GPS.Menu.create (2015-11-13)

  This python function is now obsolescent. A simple replacement is provided
  for a few releases, but we encourage you to change your plug-ins to use
  gps_utils.interactive instead, since the latter creates proper actions
  which can be reused for contextual menus or key shortcuts.

NF-170-OB12-016 GPS: highlighting focused view (2015-11-17)

  The GPS color theme was modified so that the view that currently has the
  keyboard focus has a special color in its notebook tab. Changing the color
  theme will change the colors, but will still make this tab unique.

NF-170-OB05-010 GPS: remove the Always Use External Editor pref (2015-11-06)

  This preference (which always uses an external editor rather than GPS's
  own editor) has been removed. Such editors do not conveniently give access
  to cross-references, outline, and all the other facilities provided by GPS

NF-170-OB04-001 GPS: export the output of program runs (2015-12-16)

  A new button was added to the local toolbar of the Run view, to save the
  run command output to a file.

NF-170-OB03-004 GPS: performance improvement in Project View (2015-11-20)

  The Project View is significantly faster to load - this is noticeable
  on projects that have a large number of files.

NF-170-OA29-048 GPS: collapse all project nodes in Project view (2015-11-02)

  A new button was added to the local toolbar of the Project view, to
  collapse all project nodes. This is a way to quickly cleanup the display
  after using "Locate in Project View" for a while.

NF-170-O805-011 GPS: add multi-select to Locations View (2015-11-09)

  It is now possible to select multiple items in the Locations view,
  in particular to remove or export them all in a single operation.
  If selected one item - working as before.
  If selected more than one item:
    - jumping to source code location not allowed
    - context menu is available if selected items are from one file

NF-170-O314-006 GPS: saving project before opening it's source (2015-11-05)

  Edit-source button in project properties rewrites project's
  file (with user's confirmation) before opening it in editor.
  This closes the dialog.

NF-170-N908-050 GPS: preserve size of dialogs (2015-11-10)

  Most dialogs in GPS can be resized, and GPS will now restore the last size
  you whenever the dialog is displayed again in the future (either in the
  current session or in a later session).

NF-170-N829-014 GPS: system menus (2016-01-05)

  On OSX and Unity, GPS is now able to display the menubar outside of the
  main window. This is disabled by default, since these menus are not able
  to display tooltips or key shortcuts. They can be enabled via an advanced
  preference.

NF-170-N714-016 GPS: configurable window title (2015-11-05)

  A new preference (Window Title) has been added to configure the title of
  the GPS window. Through it, you can chose whether to display any of base
  names, directory names, project name,... in the title bar.

NF-170-G222-043 GPS: menubars for floating windows (2015-11-27)

  When an editor or a browser is made floating, its window now includes a
  menubar similar to the one used in the main GPS window. This makes it
  more convenient to execute actions via menus.
  It also includes a copy of the global toolbar.

NF-170-0000-001 GPS: Incompatible changes in Python API (2016-01-04)

  This section lists changes done in the Python API that are no longer
  compatible with previous versions of GPS.

  GPS.Toolbar, GPS.Combo, GPS.ToolButton and GPS.Button removed (2016-01-04)

    This class has been removed. Only buttons associated with named actions
    can now be added (See GPS.Action.button). A benefit is that buttons can
    now be added to either the main toolbar or to the local toolbars of the
    various views. GPS can also repeat the main toolbar in every floating
    window. Since actions can also be associated with menus and key shortcuts,
    this also encouraged code reuse.

  GPS.Menu.create obsolescent (2015-12-01)

    This function is now obsolescent, and its use is discouraged (use
    GPS.Action.menu instead). A temporary version still exists, but will be
    removed in future versions.
    The benefit is that menus are now always associated with named actions,
    which can also be bound to keyshortcuts or toolbar buttons. This encourages
    code reuse, and allows disabling all GUI items related to a given action
    more easily.
