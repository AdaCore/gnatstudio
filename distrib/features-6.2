New features in GPS 6.2.0 / GNATbench 2.10.0
--------------------------------------------

NF-62-O212-080 GPS: align.py enabled on gpr files (2015-02-13)

  When editing a .gpr project file, the Align contextual menu is now
  available, as it is in Ada files

NF-62-O130-023 GPS: project properties for uneditable projects (2015-02-04)

  The Project Properties dialog can now be displayed even in cases where the
  project cannot actually be edited graphically (aggregate project, project
  using variables,...).

NF-62-O128-045 GPS: omni-search now searches in gpr files (2015-01-29)

  The 'Sources' context in the omni-search now also searches the gpr files
  themselves, in addition to the source files.

NF-62-O119-023 GPS: Revamp the project properties dialog (2015-01-28)

  We have redesigned the dialog to edit the project properties, to avoid
  the use of notebooks, since there was potentially a large number of pages
  in the notebook and it became difficult to select them.

NF-62-O108-028 GB: Debugger field added to toolchain editor (2015-01-14)

  Debugger command can be displayed and changed in the toolchain editor.

NF-62-O106-003 GPS: Better fortran syntax highlighting (2015-01-26)

  A new syntax highlighter has been added for fortran, using the new python
  highlighters engine.

NF-62-NC16-026 GPS: use of perspective for CodePeer report (2015-02-24)

  GPS now has a perspective dedicated to viewing CodePeer results.

NF-62-NB28-004 GPS: follow dialog-use-header setting (2014-11-28)

  Gtk+ has a setting (gtk-dialogs-use-header) that can be set so that dialogs
  display their buttons (OK, Cancel,...) in the header bar rather than at the
  bottom of the dialog. GPS now follows that setting properly, to adapt to the
  system's convention.

NF-62-NB24-024 GPS: sharper display on high-dpi screens (2014-11-27)

  All icons in GPS now use vectors, so that they can be displays sharply on
  all types of screens.

NF-62-NA22-010 GPS: --version and --help no longer require GUI (2014-10-23)

  The switches are parsed before GPS attempts to connect to the GUI
  environment. As a result, it is possible to get the help or the version
  even when the environment is not setup for GUI.

NF-62-N310-050 GPS: \i for sequence number in regexp replacements (2015-01-23)

  When the regular expression replacement string contains "\i" or
  "\i(start, delta)" then this pattern will be replaced with sequence numbers
  in replacement text.

NF-62-N306-050 GPS: display of CWEs from CodePeer (2015-02-04)

  GPS displays CWEs (Common Weakness Enumeration) for CodePeer's messages in
  Locations view and provides corresponding filter in CodePeer Report view.

NF-62-L908-006 GPS: use unix-style paths when editing project (2015-01-06)

  When project properties are edited, all possible occurrences of backslashes
  are replaced with slashes. This makes it possible to use such project both
  under Windows and Linux.

NF-62-HB23-004 GPS: organize /Build menu by project (2015-01-12)

  When your project (or the imported projects) has a large number of mains,
  the /Build/Project and /Build/Run menu could become very large and require
  scrolling. Instead, an extra level of menu has been added, for each
  project that has a main.
