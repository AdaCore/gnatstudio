New features in GPS 6.2.0 / GNATbench 2.10.0
--------------------------------------------

NF-62-OB17-025 Better API for GPS.Message (2015-11-19)

  The constants for the flags parameter for the GPS.Message constructor were
  wrong. The flags parameter has been replaced with optional boolean
  parameters, which are more pythonic and more explicit.

NF-62-OA22-009 GPS: Filter to include all files (2015-10-27)

  GPS has been extended to define project attributes that allow to use files
  from any loaded project. This impacts the project editor, which will
  display all those files and let users chose among them.

  "-smp" suffix automatically added to RUNTIME when smp kernel are used.

NF-62-OA20-041 GPS: remove use of stock icons (2015-10-27)

  GPS uses icon themes instead of stock icons, since Gtk+ 3.14 has marked
  stock icons as deprecated. As a result, most icons were converted to SVG
  and <stock> configuration nodes are no longer supported.

NF-62-O925-041 GPS: Add css highlighter for GPS (2015-10-05)

  Added a CSS highlighter to GPS using the Python API.

NF-62-O924-047 GB: external source folder support (2015-10-13)

  GNAT project dirs (source, object, etc...) that are located outside the GNAT
  project file tree are added automatically to the project explorer view
  through linked folders. The linked folders are created when new dirs are
  detected on GNAT project file change for example.

NF-62-O917-129 GPS: C/C++ support for limited macro xrefs (2015-11-26)

  GPS now has limited support for macro cross references, in that it can now
  navigate to macro definitions in C and C++

NF-62-O817-019 GPS: Add back aliases completion (2015-08-10)

  Aliases completion has been added back to the 6.2.0 release. The priority in
  the completion window is now lower, so that keyword completion takes
  precedence.

NF-62-O813-008 GPS: control background for read-only files (2015-10-20)

  A new preference(in Editor/Fonts & Colors) allow controlling
  whether to alter the background for read-only files.

  shared object in source code.

NF-62-O505-020 GPS: remove support for title bars for views (2015-05-05)

  We removed a few preferences in the "Windows" section related to the support
  for title bars in views. This simplifies the preference dialog.

NF-62-O422-034 GPS: the speed bar is drawn on top of the scrollbar (2015-05-04)

  The speed bar has been removed, thus saving some horizontal space: the
  information of highlights in the editor is now drawn directly on top of
  the vertical scrollbar.

NF-62-O330-022 GPS: library directories displayed in Project view (2015-03-31)

  For library project, the library directory is displayed as an explicit node
  in the Project view, in addition to the object directory.

NF-62-O327-030 GPS: GPS.Action.disable is a new python function (2015-03-30)

  Using this function, it is now possible to disable all usage of an action
  within GPS, and gray out/hide all corresponding menus.

NF-62-O326-046 GPS: Python to configure views (2015-04-10)

  The settings from the local configuration menus of the views can now be

  Add VxWorks 653 3.0.1 and later support.

NF-62-O314-005 GPS: initial dir for the "Change Directory" dialog (2015-03-17)

  Under Linux/UNIX/Mac OS, the "Change directory" dialog now opens on
  the current directory, matching the behavior already present on Windows.

NF-62-O306-034 GPS: new Color Theme window (2015-03-17)

  The plugin colorschemes.py has been modified: the way to switch
  between color themes is no longer through an entry in the Preferences
  dialog, but through a dedicated window, accessed using the menu
  Edit -> Color Themes.

  GPS now supports importing TextMate theme definitions, and a number
  of themes now ship by default with GPS.

NF-62-O220-012 GPS: makefile.py reads include statements (2015-03-24)

  Makefile targets found in included makefiles are now listed in the
  /Build/Makefile menu.

NF-62-O212-080 GPS: align.py enabled on gpr files (2015-02-13)

  When editing a .gpr project file, the Align contextual menu is now
  available, as it is in Ada files

NF-62-O209-009 GPS: control jump to first message in plugins (2015-03-02)

  Python plugins can use new parameter of GPS.Message's class constructor to
  control automatic jump to first message in category.

NF-62-O130-023 GPS: project properties for uneditable projects (2015-02-04)

  The Project Properties dialog can now be displayed even in cases where the
  project cannot actually be edited graphically (aggregate project, project
  using variables,...).

  The 'Sources' context in the omni-search now also searches the gpr files
  themselves, in addition to the source files.

NF-62-O126-037 GPS: source navigation in CodePeer-only mode (2015-03-02)

  When GPS is used with CodePeer only (no GNAT installed), the build mode is
  automatically changed to properly load the cross-references information.

NF-62-O122-041 GPS: recent searches in view filters (2015-05-05)

  The filters that exist in some views now remember recent searches, so that
  you can repeat them more easily.

NF-62-O119-023 GPS: Revamp the project properties dialog (2015-01-28)

  We have redesigned the dialog to edit the project properties, to avoid
  the use of notebooks, since there was potentially a large number of pages
  in the notebook and it became difficult to select them.

NF-62-O108-028 GB: Debugger field added to toolchain editor (2015-01-14)

  Debugger command can be displayed and changed in the toolchain editor.

NF-62-O106-003 GPS: Better fortran syntax highlighting (2015-01-26)

  highlighters engine.

NF-62-NC16-026 GPS: use of perspective for CodePeer report (2015-02-24)

  GPS now has a perspective dedicated to viewing CodePeer results.

NF-62-NB28-004 GPS: follow dialog-use-header setting (2014-11-28)

  Gtk+ has a setting (gtk-dialogs-use-header) that can be set so that dialogs
  display their buttons (OK, Cancel,...) in the header bar rather than at the
  bottom of the dialog. GPS now follows that setting properly, to adapt to the
  system's convention.

NF-62-NB24-024 GPS: sharper display on high-dpi screens (2014-11-27)

  All icons in GPS now use vectors, so that they can be displays sharply on
  all types of screens.

NF-62-NB04-009 GPS: new plugin closeold (2015-07-08)

  A new optional plugin is provided. It automatically closes the least
  recently accessed editors when new editors are opened, thus limiting the
  number of opened editors to a maximum limit. Editors can be pinned to
  prevent their automatic closing.

NF-62-NA22-010 GPS: --version and --help no longer require GUI (2014-10-23)

  The switches are parsed before GPS attempts to connect to the GUI
  environment. As a result, it is possible to get the help or the version
  even when the environment is not setup for GUI.

NF-62-N708-009 GNATdoc: support for custom tags (2015-10-05)

  GNATdoc now supports defining your own tags using Python.

NF-62-N701-030 GPS: Ability to provide fonts under UNIX (2015-04-20)

  GPS comes with a mechanism for adding custom fonts. (This does not
  work on Windows, where the fonts need to be installed at the system level).

  GPS 6.2 also comes with better default fonts out-of-the-box.

NF-62-N310-050 GPS: \i for sequence number in regexp replacements (2015-01-23)

  When the regular expression replacement string contains "\i" or
  "\i(start, delta)" then this pattern will be replaced with sequence numbers
  in replacement text.

NF-62-N306-050 GPS: display of CWEs from CodePeer (2015-02-04)

  GPS displays CWEs (Common Weakness Enumeration) for CodePeer's messages in
  Locations view and provides corresponding filter in CodePeer Report view.

NF-62-MC03-007 GPS: new switches --config and --autoconf (2015-08-17)

  GPS can now optionally parse a config file (.cgpr) before loading the
  project, like gprbuild does. Such a file is in particular useful to
  specify naming schemes for programming languages, without having to
  duplicate this information in a GPS plug-in. The file is automatically
  passed to gnatinspect.

NF-62-M719-015 GPS: search in current editor (2015-08-17)

  A new search context was added to the omni-search, to search only in the
  current editor. It is mostly intended to be used via a key shortcut.
  Whenever you press the keyshort, and then start typing some text, a
  popup window will show all matches in the current editor.

NF-62-M304-034 GPS: xref for custom languages (2015-08-17)

  GPS lets you describe programming languages via plug-ins. In particular,
  you can declare the rules used for syntax highlighting, and for the
  naming schemes of their source files. If you also declare the LI_Suffix
  to be .ali, GPS will now parse any .ali file it finds that relates to
  those source files, and automatically parse the cross-reference
  information. Those .ali files must have a structure similar to the ones
  generated by GNAT or gcc.

NF-62-L908-006 GPS: use unix-style paths when editing project (2015-01-06)

  When project properties are edited, all possible occurrences of backslashes
  are replaced with slashes. This makes it possible to use such project both
  under Windows and Linux.

NF-62-HB23-004 GPS: organize /Build menu by project (2015-01-12)

  When your project (or the imported projects) has a large number of mains,
  the /Build/Project and /Build/Run menu could become very large and require
  scrolling. Instead, an extra level of menu has been added, for each
  project that has a main.
