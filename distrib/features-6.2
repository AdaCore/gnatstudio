--------------------------------------------

NF-62-NA22-010 GPS: --version and --help no longer require GUI (2014-10-23)

  The switches are parsed before GPS attempts to connect to the GUI
  environment. As a result, it is possible to get the help or the version
  even when the environment is not setup for GUI.
