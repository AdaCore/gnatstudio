New features in GPS 6.2.0 / GNATbench 2.10.0
--------------------------------------------

NF-62-NA22-010 GPS: --version and --help no longer require GUI (2014-10-23)

  The switches are parsed before GPS attempts to connect to the GUI
  environment. As a result, it is possible to get the help or the version
  even when the environment is not setup for GUI.

NF-62-L908-006 GPS: use unix-style paths when editing project (2015-01-06)

  When project properties are edited, all possible occurrences of backslashes
  are replaced with slashes. This makes it possible to use such project both
  under Windows and Linux.

NF-62-HB23-004 GPS: organize /Build menu by project (2015-01-12)

  When your project (or the imported projects) has a large number of mains,
  the /Build/Project and /Build/Run menu could become very large and require
  scrolling. Instead, an extra level of menu has been added, for each
  project that has a main.
