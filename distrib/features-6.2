New features in GPS 6.2.0 / GNATbench 2.10.0
--------------------------------------------

NF-62-O128-045 GPS: omni-search now searches in gpr files (2015-01-29)

  The 'Sources' context in the omni-search now also searches the gpr files
  themselves, in addition to the source files.

NF-62-O119-023 GPS: Revamp the project properties dialog (2015-01-28)

  We have redesigned the dialog to edit the project properties, to avoid
  the use of notebooks, since there was potentially a large number of pages
  in the notebook and it became difficult to select them.

NF-62-O108-028 GB: Debugger field added to toolchain editor (2015-01-14)

  Debugger command can be displayed and changed in the toolchain editor.

NF-62-O106-003 GPS: Better fortran syntax highlighting (2015-01-26)

  A new syntax highlighter has been added for fortran, using the new python
  highlighters engine.

NF-62-NA22-010 GPS: --version and --help no longer require GUI (2014-10-23)

  The switches are parsed before GPS attempts to connect to the GUI
  environment. As a result, it is possible to get the help or the version
  even when the environment is not setup for GUI.

NF-62-N310-050 GPS: \i for sequence number in regexp replacements (2015-01-23)

  When the regular expression replacement string contains "\i" or
  "\i(start, delta)" then this pattern will be replaced with sequence numbers
  in replacement text.

NF-62-N306-050 GPS: display of CWEs from CodePeer (2015-02-04)

  GPS displays CWEs (Common Weakness Enumeration) for CodePeer's messages in
  Locations view and provides corresponding filter in CodePeer Report view.

NF-62-L908-006 GPS: use unix-style paths when editing project (2015-01-06)

  When project properties are edited, all possible occurrences of backslashes
  are replaced with slashes. This makes it possible to use such project both
  under Windows and Linux.

NF-62-HB23-004 GPS: organize /Build menu by project (2015-01-12)

  When your project (or the imported projects) has a large number of mains,
  the /Build/Project and /Build/Run menu could become very large and require
  scrolling. Instead, an extra level of menu has been added, for each
  project that has a main.
