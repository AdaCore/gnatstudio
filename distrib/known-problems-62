Known problems fixed in GPS 17.0 / GNATbench 17.0
-------------------------------------------------

KP-62-OC17-015 WB: error markers always at top of C/C++ files

  Problem:    Depending on the C/C++ compiler used, error markers added to
              C/C++ files during build process are all located at the top of
              the file instead of at the line reported by the marker.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-12-22

  Workaround: Disable quick fix feature. (see Ada/Tools preferences page)

KP-62-OC01-018 GPS.Exception: No file information stored in the context

  Problem:    Right clicking on the name of the project in the project pane may
              raise exception and display it in messages window when SPARK
              is installed.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-12-11

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-OB23-034 GNATdoc: compiling does not update cross references

  Problem:    Units containing subprograms with pre/post conditions may
              be incorrectly reported by GNATdoc as sources whose cross
              references are not up-to-date.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-11-27

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-OB19-033 GNATdoc: protected types are not included in documentation

  Problem:    GNATdoc doesn't generate documentation for protected types.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-11-23

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-OB19-009 GPS: GNATdoc missing --version switch

  Problem:    GNATdoc did not have a version switch.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-11-20

  Workaround: Use GPS's version switch, since versions are the same

KP-62-OA29-031 WB: fixed ada problems markers not cleared automatically

  Problem:    Ada problem markers created during "compile ada file"
              action execution are not cleared by "(re)build project" action
              executions even if the errors are fixed.
              Ada problem markers created during "(re)build project" action
              execution cannot be cleared by "compile ada file" action
              executions.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-01-04

  Workaround: clear the markers manually or relaunch the action that had
              created the markers.

KP-62-OA28-042 GPS: memory leak linked to completions

  Problem:    Using the dynamic completion causes GPS to leak memory.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-11-20

  Workaround: None known, apart from deactivating the completion.

KP-62-OA15-033 GPS: gnatcov's report not fully displayed

  Problem:    GPS displays less then 1000 lines of gnatcov report.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-12-11

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-O921-051 GNATdoc: No source code snippet for subtypes

  Problem:    GNATdoc doesn't generate source code snippet for declarations of
              subtypes of enumeration type declared in another package.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-12-01

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-O820-024 GPS: debugging aggregated projects

  Problem:    If you are using aggregate projects, the /Debug/Initialize
              behaves incorrectly when the same main unit is part of multiple
              aggregated projects. Selecting any of the corresponding menu
              will always debug the executable in the context of the same
              aggregated project, and never the others.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-11-03

  Workaround: Initialize the debugger with no main unit, and manually type
              'file <exec_name>' in the debugger console.

KP-62-O326-012 GPS: C rename refactoring

  Problem:    Rename refactoring was not working in C/C++

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-12-01

  Workaround: Manual renaming of the entity.

Known problems fixed in GPS 6.2.1 / GNATbench 2.10.1
----------------------------------------------------

KP-62-OC15-050 GPS: bitmap fonts not rendered correctly

  Problem:    Under UNIX/Linux, bitmap fonts are rendered with each glyph
              drawn backwards and not properly filled.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.1 on 2015-12-23

  Workaround: Choose TrueType fonts instead of bitmap fonts.

KP-62-OC02-029 GB: cursor jumps to top of ada file when saved

  Problem:    When saving ada files edited by the Ada Editor, the content is
              scrolled to the top, and the cursor is moved to the first line
              first column.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10.1 on 2015-12-04

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-OB24-020 GPS: Navigating to included files doesn't work

  Problem:    Clicking on an included file directive in C/C++ did not navigate
              to the file anymore.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.1 on 2015-11-24

  Workaround: Navigate to file by hand.

KP-62-OB24-007 GPS: "Remove SCIL&DB" removes unexpected directories

  Problem:    Removal of CodePeer's artifacts with the "Remove SCIL&DB" command
              also removes directories of externally built projects.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.1 on 2015-12-09

  Workaround: Protect directories using OS utilities.

KP-62-OB17-052 GPS: Inconsistent Debug menu states

  Problem:    Sometimes the state of the Debug menu is not consistent with the
              debugger session: the menu is disabled when the debugger is
              active or vice-versa.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.1 on 2015-11-18

  Workaround: Click in another window to move the focus.

KP-62-OB12-006 GPS: Locations are not restored on startup

  Problem:    Messages are not restored on startup when "Save locations on
              exit" feature of Locations view is enabled.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.1 on 2015-11-17

  Workaround: Not necessary.

KP-62-OB02-020 GB: wrong linked source folder(s) automatically created

  Problem:    At startup or on GPR file/scenario variable change, wrong linked
              folders are automatically created for source folders.
              It occurs when the existing linked source folder is not a child
              of the project node, or on windows when there is case sensitive
              difference between folder name in GPR file and folder name in the
              file system.
              These wrong linked source folders may lead to problems in ada
              problems markers to ada source editor navigation.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10.1 on 2015-11-03

  Workaround: Remove the existing linked folders and let GNATbench create them.
              On windows, let folder names be case sensitive.

KP-62-OA07-003 GPS: Crash when using libclang cross references

  Problem:    Using the new libclang cross references engine causes GPS to
              crash in some scenarios

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.1 on 2015-11-24

  Workaround: Deactivate the libclang xref engine via the LIBCLANG_XREF
              trace

KP-62-O708-028 GNATdoc: Incorrect formatting of text for parameters

  Problem:    Trailing lines of description of parameter is generated as source
              code snippet when description of parameter is started at same
              line with @param tag and have more than two lines.

  Status:     This is fixed in 6.2.1 on 2015-12-25

  Workaround: Reformat description to start at next line after @param tag.
