Known problems fixed in GPS 17.0 / GNATbench 17.0
-------------------------------------------------

KP-62-P603-024 GPS: Python exceptions when using aliases and switching editors

  Problem:    If you switch editors while an alias expansion is ongoing,
              Python exceptions will appear in the console when typing or
              moving the cursor in the other editor.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-06-03

  Workaround: Press ESC to terminate alias expansion before switching editors.

KP-62-P513-042 GPS: With clauses not shown properly in outline

  Problem:    When the "show with clauses" option was activated, instead of
              being grouped under a common parent node, they were appended to
              the top level of the outline.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-05-17

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-P429-023 GPS: renaming entity also change 'renames' statements

  Problem:    When an Ada entity is declared as a renaming of another one
              ("procedure A renames Pkg.A") and you use the code refactoring
              to rename the first A, then GPS also renames the second A
              entity above.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-05-10

  Workaround: Rename the first A, then rename the second A back to "A".

KP-62-P422-012 GPS: segfaults on very long identifiers

  Problem:    Identifiers with more than 256 characters could
              cause a GPS crash.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-05-11

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-P418-042 GPS: no harness project found in gnatcov mode

  Problem:    GPS is unable to find harness project generated by gnattest
              if Build Mode set to gnatcov/gcov.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-05-09

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-P415-035 GB: UI freeze adding watch expression

  Problem:    During a debug session and running "Add Watch Expression" menu,
              if the cursor or the selection is not pointing to ada variable(s)
              the UI is freezed. GNATbench process should be killed and
              restarted.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-05-03

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-P412-027 GPS: 'load' command automatically sent to GDB

  Problem:    GPS automatically loads the executable being debugged
              when starting GDB on a remote target (i.e: when the
              IDE'Protocol_Host and IDE'Communication_Protocol are
              set), flashing the board each time that a debug
              session is launched.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-04-25

  Workaround: Remove the IDE'Protocol_Host and IDE'Communication_Protocol
              from your project and connect to the board manually in the
              GDB console to start your debug sesssion without loading
              the executable.

KP-62-P407-005 GPS: GPS.Message.get_flags returns wrong value

  Problem:    GPS.Message.get_flags() returns inversed value. Scripts should be
              modified to reflect fix of this bug.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-04-19

  Workaround: Not needed.

KP-62-P331-016 GPS: indentation depends on end-of-line spaces

  Problem:    When the end of the line contains blanks then
              next line starts with indent from last blank.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-04-06

  Workaround: Do not set blanks at the end of lines.

KP-62-P331-007 GPS: not starting the debugger from project

  Problem:    When you initialize the debugger with the menu
              "/Debug/Initialize/No Main", gps will always spawn gdb,
              rather than the debugger mentioned in your project via the
              IDE'Debugger_Command attribute.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-04-04

  Workaround: This only occurs when initializing with no main, so the best
              is to set up the Main attribute in your project, and then select
              that main in the /Debug/Initialize menu.

KP-62-P330-050 GPS: select row in Attach dialog scrolls to top

  Problem:    After you start the debugger, if you open the dialog
              Debugger/Data/Attach to attach to an existing process and
              then select a row in the list, the list scrolls back to the
              top, which is confusing.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-03-31

  Workaround: Scroll back the list as needed. The selection was properly
              handled, so you can also click on the OK button directly.

KP-62-P328-005 Indentation engine on aggregates

  Problem:    The following is wrongly auto-indented if the preferences for
              conditional continuation lines is different than the default
              value of 1:
                 for Primary_Colour use
                    (Red   => 1,
                     Green => 4);

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-03-30

  Workaround: Indent manually.

KP-62-P324-031 GB: xref not working on aggregate projects

  Problem:    Navigation & References are not working when working on aggregate
              projects.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-03-24

  Workaround: Move aggregated projects to root projects using GNAT project's
              GNATbench properties page.

KP-62-P323-030 GPS: can't unfloat windows

  Problem:    In some cases, it is impossible to unfloat a window (like
              Search for instance), because selecting the /Window/Unfloat
              menu automatically gives back the focus to another view.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-04-03

  Workaround: The solution we implemented is that floating windows now have
              a local configuration menu with an "Unfloat" item. The only
              workaround is to use a command from the python console:
                 GPS.MDI.get("Search").float(False)
              or of course bind this to a key shortcut

KP-62-P323-023 GPS: Focus/selection issue with the Search dialog

  Problem:    When the Search dialog is given the input focus, the
              search entry is given the keyboard focus after a small delay,
              which can make it cumbersome to quickly enter data in the
              replace entry.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-04-11

  Workaround: Dock the Search window as part of the MDI.

KP-62-P317-010 GPS: missing underscores in /Files/Recent

  Problem:    File names displayed in the /Files/Recent menu are missing
              underscore characters.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-03-17

  Workaround: This is a display issue only, and the tooltip on the menu
              shows the proper name.

KP-62-P310-027 GPS: crash or freeze when using the menu Project->Recent

  Problem:    Opening a project using the Project->Recent menu can cause
              GPS to freeze or crash.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-03-22

  Workaround: Use another way of opening the project, for instance through
              Project->Open...

KP-62-P309-052 GPS: 'include sub-directories' is lost in project editor

  Problem:    If you make a change to Project Properties via the GUI, it will
              discard all include sub-directories selections from the Source
              Directories page.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-03-25

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-P309-043 GPS: GNATemu plug-in doesn't use Exec_Dir attribute

  Problem:    Using the "Run with emulator" or "Debug with emulator" buttons,
              the project file attribute "Exec_Dir" is not taken into account,
              which means GNATemu is called with a wrong executable path.

  Status:     This is fixed in 17.0 on 2016-03-22

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-P216-047 GPS: the menu Tools->Metrics does not appear

  Problem:    The menu Tools->Metrics does not appear when the context does
              not match, ie when the window that currently has the focus
              does not contain information about an Ada source or a project.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-03-29

  Workaround: Give the focus to a graphical element to which the menu applies.

KP-62-P216-002 GPS: Libclang parsing files task not finishing.

  Problem:    When working on C/C++ projects, the "libclang parsing files" task
              would often not finish.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-03-20

  Workaround: Disable clang crossrefs via the LIBCLANG_XREF trace.

KP-62-P212-014 GPS: Preference "highlight entities" not taken into account

  Problem:    The preference "highlight entities" in the
              auto_highlight_occurrences plugin is not taken into account,
              and is considered always enabled.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-02-16

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-P211-059 GPS: Wrong sort order of directories in Project View

  Problem:    Expanding one project changes order of object and execute
              directories in another expanded project.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-02-16

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-P211-035 GPS: Bad performance on C++ projects

  Problem:    All around typing performance in C++ was too slow.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-04-07

  Workaround: Disable clang crossrefs via the LIBCLANG_XREF trace.

KP-62-P204-004 GPS: rewind source file on debugger initialization

  Problem:    Initialization of debugger session rewind source file to the
              first line.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-02-08

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-P201-089 GPS: inconsistence of message counters in CodePeer report

  Problem:    Message counters in CodePeer Report view and Locations view is
              inconsistence in some combinations of selection of check
              categories.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-02-03

  Workaround: Not needed.

KP-62-P201-061 GPS: exception raised when typing ':' in the omnisearch

  Problem:    Searching for a pattern that begins with the ':' character in
              the omnisearch bar raises a Constraint_Error. This problem only
              appears when the search provider for filenames is enabled.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-02-02

  Workaround: Not needed.

KP-62-P128-011 GPS: key shortcuts not working on read-only editors

  Problem:    Using key shortcuts based on 'control' and a character
              (for instance control-a for "select all") do not work on
              readonly editors.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-01-28

  Workaround: Make the editor temporarily writable by clicking on the
              icon in the bottom-right corner.

KP-62-P122-042 GPS: invisible cursor after using incremental search

  Problem:    Cursor in the editor is no more visible after using the
              incremental search. This happens on Microsoft Windows only.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-02-08

  Workaround: Switch to a floating GPS windows and back to make cursor
              visible.

KP-62-P122-041 GPS: Outline becomes empty after filtering

  Problem:    Using the filter in the outline could render the outline empty,
              even after removing the filter.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-01-26

  Workaround: Don't use the outline's filter.

KP-62-P122-015 GPS: Too much memory used on big C/C++ projects

  Problem:    Indexing C/C++ files uses a lot of memory for very big projects.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-03-20

  Workaround: Disable clang crossrefs via the LIBCLANG_XREF trace.

KP-62-P119-022 ECL: problem with build started automatically during clean

  Problem:    When Running "Clean Project" command, if "Start a build
              automatically" button is checked, some build commands are failing
              because they are starting before the end of the clean command.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-02-18

  Workaround: Enable "Project > Build Automatically" feature, or uncheck
              "Start a build automatically" button and build manually projects
              when clean commands are completed.

KP-62-P113-013 GPS: cannot display standard.ads on cross platform

  Problem:    When the system is configured for a cross or bareboard platform,
              GPS is not able to display /Help/GNAT Runtime/Standard. This
              package needs to be dynamically computed by the compiler, and
              using gnatmake does not work in such a context. The GPS plug-in
              was updated to use gprbuild instead.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-01-14

  Workaround: On the command line, run
              'gprbuild -c -gnatc -gnatS -P<project> <file>' where project is
              your project file and file is any source file.

KP-62-P113-008 GPS: problem with folding of directory in Project View

  Problem:    After unfolding a row in Project View by clicking on the
              arrow icon it is impossible to fold it back until some mouse
              movement.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-01-20

  Workaround: Use double click outside arrow icon or keyboard shortcuts
              to fold the row.

KP-62-P108-044 GPS: incorrect program arguments when debugging in GPS

  Problem:    When argument of a program contains backslash character
              GPS escapes it in a wrong way before pass to GDB. As a result
              all arguments are passed as single argument with escaped
              backslash characters.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-01-20

  Workaround: Use 'start <arguments>' command in GDB console of GPS instead
              of running program with F8 or 'continue' icon.

KP-62-P107-003 GPS: subprogram rename refactoring problem

  Problem:    Renaming of subprogram without separate declaration could fail,
              if new name contains old one as a prefix. In this case renaming
              performed twice.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-02-08

  Workaround: Perform renaming twice using intermediate name, that is not
              a prefix of old name.

KP-62-OC11-015 GPS: Refactoring/Extract' subprograms ignores parameters

  Problem:    The 'Refactoring/Extract subprogram' action does not work
              correctly if the file being edited does not have up-to-date
              cross-references.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-03-16

  Workaround: Recompile the file before executing this action in order
              to have proper cross-references.

KP-62-OC02-026 WB: absolute GPRPATH in generated scenario.makefile file

  Problem:    The generated scenario.makefile contains an absolute GPRPATH
              entry. This entry makes scenario.makefile file hard to handle.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-02-12

  Workaround: Avoid to save scenario.makefile file in version control and
              exclude it when copying ada projects. The scenario.makefile file
              will be automatically generated when Wind River Workbench is
              started or when the project is opened/imported.

KP-62-OC01-018 GPS.Exception: No file information stored in the context

  Problem:    Right clicking on the name of the project in the project pane may
              raise exception and display it in messages window when SPARK
              is installed.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-12-11

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-OB19-033 GNATdoc: protected types are not included in documentation

  Problem:    GNATdoc doesn't generate documentation for protected types.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-11-23

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-OB19-009 GPS: GNATdoc missing --version switch

  Problem:    GNATdoc did not have a version switch.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-11-20

  Workaround: Use GPS's version switch, since versions are the same

KP-62-OB18-028 GPS: Replace All corrupts edited source file

  Problem:    When the search pattern is longer than the replace string,
              "Replace All" is not working properly and could corrupt the
              edited file.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-11-25

  Workaround: Replace occurences one by one using "Replace & Find" function.

KP-62-OA28-042 GPS: memory leak linked to completions

  Problem:    Using the dynamic completion causes GPS to leak memory.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-11-20

  Workaround: None known, apart from deactivating the completion.

KP-62-OA28-026 GPS: dialog appears at mouse cursor position

  Problem:    Some GPS dialogs appear at position of the mouse cursor.
              This is inconvenient in case of multi-monitor setup.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-03-09

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-OA15-033 GPS: gnatcov's report not fully displayed

  Problem:    GPS displays less then 1000 lines of gnatcov report.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-12-11

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-O921-051 GNATdoc: No source code snippet for subtypes

  Problem:    GNATdoc doesn't generate source code snippet for declarations of
              subtypes of enumeration type declared in another package.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-12-01

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-O820-024 GPS: debugging aggregated projects

  Problem:    If you are using aggregate projects, the /Debug/Initialize
              behaves incorrectly when the same main unit is part of multiple
              aggregated projects. Selecting any of the corresponding menu
              will always debug the executable in the context of the same
              aggregated project, and never the others.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-11-03

  Workaround: Initialize the debugger with no main unit, and manually type
              'file <exec_name>' in the debugger console.

KP-62-O723-009 GPS: specifying project for coding standard

  Problem:    The contextual menu "check coding standards" works on
              the root project rather than the selected project.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-01-28

  Workaround: Edit the gnatcheck.py file manually. Replace
              GPS.Project.root().file().name("Tools_Server") + '"""' by
              project.file().name("Tools_Server") + '"""'

KP-62-O326-012 GPS: C rename refactoring

  Problem:    Rename refactoring was not working in C/C++

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-12-01

  Workaround: Manual renaming of the entity.

KP-62-NA21-042 GPS: No vertical scrolling of filters of CodePeer report

  Problem:    Bottom rows of CodePeer report are not visible when size of GPS
              window is small enought to display filters panel completely.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-04-01

  Workaround: Resize GPS window.

KP-62-NA09-049 GPS: CodePeer messages are not displayed in Locations view

  Problem:    CodePeer messages are not displayed after close and reopen of
              Locations view.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-03-29

  Workaround: Restart GPS.

Known problems fixed in GPS 6.2.2 / GNATbench 2.10.2
----------------------------------------------------

KP-62-P509-035 GNATdoc: ignore comments for subtype of enumeration type

  Problem:    GNATdoc ignore comments for subtype of enumeration type.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.2 on 2016-05-09

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-P415-043 WB: toolchains not set when converting vx6/vx6cert projects

  Problem:    When converting a vx6 or vx6cert Wind River Workbench project,
              the selected toolchains of the last dialog box are not based on
              the project's available build specs.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10.2 on 2016-04-29

  Workaround: Check manually the toolchains used by the project's build specs.

KP-62-P415-008 GPS: incorrect reload of breakpoints

  Problem:    In some cases, breakpoints are incorrectly reloaded when
              starting a new debugger session.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.2 on 2016-04-15

  Workaround: The breakpoints are set at the beginning of the subprogram,
              rather than on the specific line. Once the debugger stops,
              you can simply click on the line to set a new breakpoint.

KP-62-P412-005 GPS: hangs or crash when triggering the smart completion.

  Problem:    GPS might hang or crash when some files become modified
              after the smart completion was opened.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.2 on 2016-04-28

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-P411-035 WB: bad SMP RUNTIME used for arm target on VxWorks-6.x

  Problem:    gprconfig failure when building DKM & RTP for SMP
              ,arm-wrs-vxworks and VxWorks-6.x targets. The error reported in
              the console log is:
              Error: no compiler found for language 'ada',
                     target = arm-wrs-vxworks, runtime = [kernel|rtp]-smp

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10.2 on 2016-04-12

  Workaround: For each generated gnat.makefile file, change RUNTIME_SUFFIX
              variable initialization, to avoid the use of the -smp suffix
              when compiling a DKM or RTP for arm-wrs-vxworks target.

              ifdef _WRS_CONFIG_SMP_DEFINED
              ifneq (arm-wrs-vxworks,$(PLATFORM))
                  RUNTIME_SUFFIX:=-smp
              endif
              endif

KP-62-P411-034 GPS: reports file write error for temporary files

  Problem:    GPS reports file write errors when CodePeer report is open and
              source directory is not writable.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.2 on 2016-04-13

  Workaround: Change permissions of directory to be writable.

KP-62-P404-044 GPS: error when editing multiple projects

  Problem:    When you select /Project/Edit Properties, and in select
              multiple projects in the "Apply changes to" section, GPS ends
              up with an internal error and does not perform any of the
              updates.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.2 on 2016-04-05

  Workaround: Modifying multiple projects at the same time is generally not
              a good idea since they will end up with the exact same contents.
              The workaround is to edit the projects one by one, or manually
              (if you have lots of projects, manual editing is the recommended
              approach for now).

KP-62-P404-041 WB: User Guide contents is incorrect on Workbench-4/VxWorks-7

  Problem:    Creating DKM & RTP documentation when running Workbench-4 is
              incorrect. It is related only to Workbench-3.x platform.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10.2 on 2016-04-12

  Workaround: Ignore standard/flexible managed build information (only
              flexible managed build are supported on Workbench-4)
              Use only "gnu" build spec.

KP-62-P404-015 GPS: separate.py plug-in does not raise the editor

  Problem:    When this optional plug-in is activated, it displays a
              "Goto separate body of..." in the contextual menu for Ada
              separates. This menus jumps to the place where "is separate"
              occurs in the source code, but the corresponding editor is
              not raised when it was already opened.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.2 on 2016-04-04

  Workaround: Select "Goto body" twice to jump between actual body and
              the location of "is separate".

KP-62-P331-035 WB: invalid --target argument used calling gprconfig

  Problem:    When building Wind River Workbench projects converted to ada
              projects, sometimes the generated PLATFORM variable is not a
              valid value for a gprconfig's "--target=" argument.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10.2 on 2016-04-05

  Workaround: Change the gnat.makefile content to use a new GPR_TARGET variable
              initialized using BUILD_SPEC variable.
              ex:
                 ifeq (SIMNTgnu,$(BUILD_SPEC))
                    GPR_TARGET=i586-wrs-vxworks
                 endif
                 [...]
                 $(TRACE_FLAG)gprconfig $(QUIET) --target=$(GPR_TARGET) \

KP-62-P330-030 GPS: reusing the Project Editor corrupts project files

  Problem:    If you are using the Project Properties editor to modify
              one project, then switch to another project, then use
              the Project Properties editor again, the new project
              might contain data coming from the previous project.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.2 on 2016-04-05

  Workaround: Restart GPS before editing the second project.

KP-62-P329-035 GPS: missing display of icon in Bookmarks view

  Problem:    The first column in the Bookmarks view list contains text
              instead of an icon.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.2 on 2016-03-30

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-P322-013 GB: ada navigation failure

  Problem:    Navigating to an Ada source file that exists in the workspace
              in multiple projects (for example, a general project containing
              an svn checkout of this file and an imported existing GNAT
              project containing a link to this file) is not always working
              fine. The navigation is not working, or the opened file is seen
              as a foreign Ada sources file.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10.2 on 2016-03-23

  Workaround: Move non-Ada projects containing target Ada file to another
              workspace.

KP-62-P321-032 GPS: State of Undo/Redo buttons not updated

  Problem:    The state of the Undo/Redo buttons is not updated when
              the file permissions have been changed outside of GPS.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.2 on 2016-03-28

  Workaround: Switch to another source editor and back.

KP-62-P309-004 GPS: hang when viewing codepeer.csv report

  Problem:    GPS could hang on displaying a codepeer tooltip at the beginning
              of the viewed file.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.2 on 2016-03-30

  Workaround: None

KP-62-P308-047 GB: Allow GPR file to have filename different from project name

  Problem:    To be handled by GB, GPR files had to have a name equal to their
              project node name.
              ex: Prj.gpr to be handled by GB must have the following content
                  ...
                  project Prj is
                  ...
                  end Prj;

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10.2 on 2016-03-11

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-P301-024 GPS: GPS.Hook.remove not working

  Problem:    The GPS.Hook.remove method does not remove the hook callback
              given in argument from the list of callbacks to call when
              the given hook is run.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.2 on 2016-03-04

  Workaround: Use a global variable that is set to True once the hook
              callback is called and do nothing in the callback if this
              boolean is set.

KP-62-P224-028 GPS: Impossibility to choose custom colors for code highlighting

  Problem:    Users are unable to choose custom colors for code highlighting
              without changing the Color Theme itself: the "Fonts & Colors"
              preferences page only offers the possibility to customize font
              styles.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.2 on 2016-02-25

  Workaround: Keep the previous preferences.xml (with customized colors) if
              any.

KP-62-P218-045 GB: Problems in GPR files reported in editor at line 1

  Problem:    Problems in GPR files detected during clean/analyze/build
              commands are reported in the editor at line 1 instead of the
              line reported by the location column of the problems view.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10.2 on 2016-02-25

  Workaround: Scroll manually to the line provided in the location column
              of the problems view.

KP-62-P215-044 GPS: GPS locks up on Ada completion

  Problem:    GPS might hang or crash when triggering the smart
              completion on projects that contain C files.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.2 on 2016-03-30

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-P208-069 GPS: debugging session ignores terminate

  Problem:    When an application is running under debugger the termination
              of the debugger session doesn't stop the application.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.2 on 2016-03-02

  Workaround: Interrupt the execution manually before terminating the debugger
              session.

KP-62-P204-042 GB: "Problem occurred" dialog displayed during "Content Assist"

  Problem:    Sometimes within AdaCore's ada editor, a "Problem Occurred"
              dialog is displayed when pressing Ctrl+Space to request
              completion proposals. The completion proposals are not displayed.
              The error message reports an access check failed exception in
              Ada_Semantic_Tree.Std_Entities package.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10.2 on 2016-02-09

  Workaround: Type more characters and press again Ctrl+Space.

KP-62-P129-014 GB: Spurious "Define template" content assist window displayed

  Problem:    Sometimes within AdaCore's ada editor,  when entering '.' or '('
              characters, a completion proposal containing the text from the
              cursor position to the end of the current line and having
              "Define template" documentation is displayed. If Enter key is
              pressed when this Spurious completion proposal is displayed, the
              completion proposal text is added at the cursor location and the
              new line is not created.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10.2 on 2016-02-05

  Workaround: Press Escape key to close spurious completion proposal or disable
              code assist feature. (see Ada > Tools preferences page)

KP-62-P126-014 WB: wrs_rtp_base defined more than once on VxWorks-7 RTP builds.

  Problem:    When building VxWorks 7 Real Time Process, __wrs_rtp_base can be
              defined more than once.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10.2 on 2016-01-28

  Workaround: In gnat.makefile, add after gprbuild invocation, the following
              line.
              objcopypentium -L __wrs_rtp_base $(GPRBUILD_OBJECT)
              Note: You may have to call objcopyppc or objcopyarm instead of
              objcopypentium.

KP-62-P121-016 WB: undefined reference to `_Unwind_Resume'

  Problem:    When building VxWorks Cert 6.x Real Time Process (RTP)
              Application using rtp runtime, a lot of undefined reference to
              _Unwind_* problems are reported

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10.2 on 2016-04-07

  Workaround: add the following libraries to linker switches:
              "-lgnat -lgcc_eh" when libgcc_eh is part of the compiler,
              "-lgnat -lgcc" when libgcc_eh is not part of the compiler.

KP-62-P112-044 WB: multiple definition of `_dtors', `_ctors'

  Problem:    When building VxWorks 6.x Downloadable Kernel Module (DKM)
              multiple definition of `_dtors' and `_ctors' problems may be
              reported.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10.2 on 2016-01-12

  Workaround: add -noauto-register linker switch. This can be done:
              - adding the noauto-register switch in the linker package of the
                DKM GNAT project file (GPR)
                package Linker is
                    for Switches ('Ada') use ("-noauto-register");
                end Linker;
              - appending '-largs -noauto-register' to the gprbuild command in
                the DKM makefile (usually named gnat.makefile)

KP-62-P106-023 GB: no project opened by GPS when launched from GB on linux.

  Problem:    On linux, GPS launched by GB through "GPS debugger" debug
              configuration or through "GNAT Project/Edit Properties" menu is
              not able to open the selected GNAT project. It opens an empty
              project. The properties dialog when required is not displayed.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10.2 on 2016-01-08

  Workaround: After GPS was launched, open the GNAT Project, and when required
              to edit the properties, run Edit Project Properties menu.

KP-62-P104-018 WB: multiple definition errors when building RTP on Workbench-4

  Problem:    A real time process (RTP) application converted to an ada project
              cannot be built without manual modification.
              Building the project is failing because a lot of symbols are
              defined more than once.
              Ex: __argc, __argv, _start, environ, etc...

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10.2 on 2016-01-06

  Workaround: Edit the GNAT project file (gpr) and add "-r" and "-nostdlib"
              switches to the linker package.

              package Linker is
                 for Default_Switches ("ada") use ("-r", "-nostdlib");
              end Linker;

KP-62-OC21-028 GPS: indentation parameters are not used for custom languages

  Problem:    The source editor uses default indentation parameters for custom
              languages instead of use same parameters are used by the parent
              language. In particular this fixes the auto-indentation in
              project files.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.2 on 2016-02-17

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-OC17-015 WB: error markers always at top of C/C++ files

  Problem:    Depending on the C/C++ compiler used, error markers added to
              C/C++ files during build process are all located at the top of
              the file instead of at the line reported by the marker.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10.2 on 2015-12-22

  Workaround: Disable quick fix feature. (see Ada/Tools preferences page)

KP-62-OC15-045 GNATdoc: crash processing record types with null components

  Problem:    GNATdoc cannot process record type declarations with null
              components.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.2 on 2016-01-15

  Workaround: Add a dummy component to the record type.

KP-62-OB23-034 GNATdoc: compiling does not update cross references

  Problem:    Units containing subprograms with pre/post conditions may
              be incorrectly reported by GNATdoc as sources whose cross
              references are not up-to-date.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.2 on 2016-01-15

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-OA29-031 WB: fixed ada problems markers not cleared automatically

  Problem:    Ada problem markers created during "compile ada file"
              action execution are not cleared by "(re)build project" action
              executions even if the errors are fixed.
              Ada problem markers created during "(re)build project" action
              execution cannot be cleared by "compile ada file" action
              executions.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10.2 on 2016-01-04

  Workaround: clear the markers manually or relaunch the action that had
              created the markers.

KP-62-O708-055 GPS: hyperlinks not very visible in Darkside and Monokai themes

  Problem:    The default color of the hyperlinks is not very easy to read
              on the dark backgrounds.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.2 on 2016-03-29

  Workaround: Change the corresponding preference manually.

KP-62-OC15-050 GPS: bitmap fonts not rendered correctly

  Problem:    Under UNIX/Linux, bitmap fonts are rendered with each glyph
              drawn backwards and not properly filled.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.1 on 2015-12-23

  Workaround: Choose TrueType fonts instead of bitmap fonts.

KP-62-OC02-029 GB: cursor jumps to top of ada file when saved

  Problem:    When saving ada files edited by the Ada Editor, the content is
              scrolled to the top, and the cursor is moved to the first line
              first column.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10.1 on 2015-12-04

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-OB24-020 GPS: Navigating to included files doesn't work

  Problem:    Clicking on an included file directive in C/C++ did not navigate
              to the file anymore.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.1 on 2015-11-24

  Workaround: Navigate to file by hand.

KP-62-OB24-007 GPS: "Remove SCIL&DB" removes unexpected directories

  Problem:    Removal of CodePeer's artifacts with the "Remove SCIL&DB" command
              also removes directories of externally built projects.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.1 on 2015-12-09

  Workaround: Protect directories using OS utilities.

KP-62-OB17-052 GPS: Inconsistent Debug menu states

  Problem:    Sometimes the state of the Debug menu is not consistent with the
              debugger session: the menu is disabled when the debugger is
              active or vice-versa.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.1 on 2015-11-18

  Workaround: Click in another window to move the focus.

KP-62-OB12-006 GPS: Locations are not restored on startup

  Problem:    Messages are not restored on startup when "Save locations on
              exit" feature of Locations view is enabled.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.1 on 2015-11-17

  Workaround: Not necessary.

KP-62-OB02-020 GB: wrong linked source folder(s) automatically created

  Problem:    At startup or on GPR file/scenario variable change, wrong linked
              folders are automatically created for source folders.
              It occurs when the existing linked source folder is not a child
              of the project node, or on windows when there is case sensitive
              difference between folder name in GPR file and folder name in the
              file system.
              These wrong linked source folders may lead to problems in ada
              problems markers to ada source editor navigation.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10.1 on 2015-11-03

  Workaround: Remove the existing linked folders and let GNATbench create them.
              On windows, let folder names be case sensitive.

KP-62-OA07-003 GPS: Crash when using libclang cross references

  Problem:    Using the new libclang cross references engine causes GPS to
              crash in some scenarios

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.1 on 2015-11-24

  Workaround: Deactivate the libclang xref engine via the LIBCLANG_XREF
              trace

KP-62-O806-012 GPS: save_on_compile plugin doesn't work with aggregate projects

  Problem:    The plugin would assume that the project necessarily had an
              object dir, which isn't the case for aggregate project.

  Status:     This is fixed in 6.2.1 on 2015-09-04

  Workaround: Save the files manually.

KP-62-O708-028 GNATdoc: Incorrect formatting of text for parameters

  Problem:    Trailing lines of description of parameter is generated as source
              code snippet when description of parameter is started at same
              line with @param tag and have more than two lines.

  Status:     This is fixed in 6.2.1 on 2015-12-25

  Workaround: Reformat description to start at next line after @param tag.
