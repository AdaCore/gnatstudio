Known problems fixed in GPS 17.0 / GNATbench 17.0
-------------------------------------------------

KP-62-OB19-033 GNATdoc: protected types are not included in documentation

  Problem:    GNATdoc doesn't generate documentation for protected types.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-11-23

  Workaround: None.

KP-62-OB19-009 GPS: GNATdoc missing --version switch

  Problem:    GNATdoc did not have a version switch.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-11-20

  Workaround: Use GPS's version switch, since versions are the same

KP-62-O820-024 GPS: debugging aggregated projects

  Problem:    If you are using aggregate projects, the /Debug/Initialize
              behaves incorrectly when the same main unit is part of multiple
              aggregated projects. Selecting any of the corresponding menu
              will always debug the executable in the context of the same
              aggregated project, and never the others.

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2015-11-03

  Workaround: Initialize the debugger with no main unit, and manually type
              'file <exec_name>' in the debugger console.

Known problems fixed in GPS 6.2.1 / GNATbench 2.10.1
----------------------------------------------------

KP-62-OB12-006 GPS: Locations are not restored on startup

  Problem:    Messages are not restored on startup when "Save locations on
              exit" feature of Locations view is enabled.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.1 on 2015-11-17

  Workaround: Not necessary.
