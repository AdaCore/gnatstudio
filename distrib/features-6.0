New features in GPS 6.0.2 / GNATbench 2.8.2
-------------------------------------------

NF-60-N320-060 GPS: support for Android/Linux (2014-03-20)

  GPS now supports the arm-linux-androideabi toolchain.

New features in GPS 6.0.0 / GNATbench 2.8.0
-------------------------------------------

NF-60-MA02-018 GPS: change current line color in debugger (2013-10-03)

  A new preference has been added to control the color of the current line
  in the debugger.

NF-60-M926-036 GPS: filter in Locations matches on file names (2013-09-26)

  The filter in the Locations window now matches the location of the messages,
  not just their text. It is also possible to force alphabetical sorting
  of file names.

NF-60-M923-010 GPS: Searching for documentation after declaration (2013-09-23)

  A new preference "Documentation/Leading Comments" has been added to
  control the order in which GPS looks at the comments (before or
  after the declaration) to retrieve the documentation for an entity.

NF-60-M919-026 GPS: Find All References displays context (2013-09-19)

  When you perform a "Find All References", each reference will also display
  the context of that reference (in general, the subprogram within which the
  reference is found).

NF-60-M918-040 GPS: safer saving of files (2013-09-19)

  Saving files is now done via a temporary file which is later renamed.
  This is safer, and protects against temporary disk issues that could occur
  during the actual save operation.

NF-60-M916-026 GPS: support for retina displays in browsers (2013-09-17)

  The display in the various browsers (e.g., call graph, entity, and debugger)
  is now sharper on retina displays.

NF-60-M913-030 GPS: align end-of-line comments (2013-09-13)

  The align.py plugin now provides a solution to align end of line comments.

NF-60-M913-009 GPS: persistent contents of Debug/Connect To Board (2013-09-13)

  The contents of the dialog to connect to a board (target name and protocol)
  is now restored each time the dialog is displayed, avoiding the need to
  enter the same information each time the dialog is used.

NF-60-M913-008 GPS: Build/Settings/Target window now resizable (2013-09-13)

  The window to edit the build targets has a smaller default size and is
  resizable. It fits better on smaller screens.

NF-60-M904-022 GPS: search dialog shows name of current project (2013-09-10)

  The search dialog provides a "Scope" to only search in the source files of
  the current project. The dialog was improved to show exactly which project
  is considered current. Also, "/Navigate/Search" from an editor will set the
  current project to be that of the editor.

NF-60-M902-008 GPS: better error for invalid project names (2013-09-02)

  The error message when creating a new project with an invalid name now
  indicates that the name cannot be an Ada reserved word.

NF-60-M817-003 GPS: window title now lists the base name first (2013-08-19)

  The GPS window's title has been changed slightly, so that the base name of
  the current file appears first, then its directory, and finally the project.
  On operating systems where the truncated title of the window is displayed in
  the task bar, this makes choosing between multiple GPS instances easier.

NF-60-M816-002 GPS: display text only in the toolbar (2013-08-19)

  There is a new preference to set the toolbar style to "text only".

NF-60-M814-011 GPS: Enhanced Edit/Selection/Refill behavior (2013-10-07)

  When refilling a comment block with the "Refill" command, the cursor
  will now be placed at the end of the last word of the comment to
  allow the user to keep editing his comment seamlessly.

NF-60-M808-017 GPS: New menu CodePeer>Generate CSV Report (2013-09-22)

  As part of the CodePeer integration, a new menu is provided to generate
  a CSV report file directly from GPS.

NF-60-M807-066 GPS: new plug-in modules.py (2013-08-12)

  A new Python support script named modules.py has been added to GPS.
  It provides a high-level interface for extending GPS. In particular, it
  makes it possible to create new views that are saved in the desktop and
  restored when GPS is restarted.

NF-60-M806-037 GPS: new command line -X (2013-08-22)

  This new switch is similar to -X in gprbuid, and can be used to set the
  value of the scenario variables found in your project.

NF-60-M806-016 GPS: reorganize editor status bars (2013-08-06)

  Changed the order of buttons and text in the status bar to avoid
  flickering when the location is changed or a selection is made, since
  we now display the amount of selected text.

NF-60-M731-021 GPS: prevent possible locations for views (2013-07-31)

  GPS now adds a restriction as to where editors and views can be put.
  Editors can only be part of the perspective-independent part of the
  desktop so they always remain visible when switching perspectives.

NF-60-M716-040 GPS: new preference to override tooltip colors (2013-07-31)

  A new preference was added in the "Windows" page to override the
  background of tooltips as set by the gtk+ theme.

NF-60-M712-005 GPS: support for displays with 16 bpp (2013-07-12)

  GPS now supports displays with a color depth of 16 bits per pixels.

NF-60-M712-004 GPS: syntax highlighting of aspects (2013-07-29)

  Ada 2012 and SPARK 2014 aspects are highlighted with a different color
  (configurable via preferences), increasing their visibility when editing
  source files.

NF-60-M711-059 GPS: do not save Locations by default (2013-09-06)

  By default, the contents of the Locations window is no longer saved
  when GPS exits (and restored when it restarts), because it sometimes
  resulted in very long loading times. The previous behavior can be
  reactivated by using the local configuration menu in the toolbar of
  the Locations window.

NF-60-M711-042 GPS: <tab> also aligns selected lines (2013-09-12)

  By default, if multiple lines are selected and you press <tab>, GPS
  will also align the colons (:), use clauses (use), arrows (=>) and
  assignments (:=) in these lines. This behavior can be deactivated
  by a new preference in the "Editors" section.

NF-60-M711-028 GPS: tooltip while scrolling in editors (2013-07-11)

  When manipulating an editor scrollbar with the mouse, a tooltip is
  displayed that shows the current line and entity.

NF-60-M710-029 GPS: display size of selection in editors (2013-07-10)

  When a selection exists in an editor, the status bar will display the
  number of characters and lines that are selected.

NF-60-M710-025 GPS: display build progress when build completes (2013-07-10)

  When a build terminates with a failure, GPS now displays the total
  progress (as displayed by the task manager) in the console. This
  makes it easier to know how many files were compiled before the
  first compilation error.

NF-60-M710-010 GPS: highlighting of numeric values (2013-07-29)

  GPS now supports highlighting of numeric values in the code editor and
  provides a new user preference to customize it.

NF-60-M709-025 GPS: reopen messages window as needed (2013-07-10)

  Even if the Messages window is somehow closed, GPS will automatically
  reopen it as necessary.

NF-60-M709-011 GPS: update default color scheme (2013-07-10)

  GPS now features a more modern default syntax highlighting color scheme for
  the code editor.

NF-60-M708-023 GPS: middle-click on tab closes the window (2013-07-08)

  A middle-click on a tab closes the window.  This is close to the
  behavior most web browsers implement and is a convenient way to
  quickly close a number of tabs.

NF-60-M705-044 GPS: vertical tabs (2013-07-08)

  It is now possible to change the orientation of the text via the contextual
  menu on each notebook tab. For instance, displaying the tabs on the left
  will rotate the text bottom-to-top, thus saving horizontal space.

NF-60-M705-018 GPS: clean up Plug-ins dialog (2013-07-05)

  The plug-ins dialog has been simplified. It no longer shows the Python
  files that are mandatory for GPS and no longer supports custom
  initialization commands for the modules (since standard Python can be
  used for this). The implementation of the plug-ins is now accessible via
  hyperlinks, instead of being directly displayed in this dialog.

NF-60-M625-035 GPS: style for build buttons in the toolbar (2013-07-01)

  The rendering has been modified for the build buttons in the toolbar
  so that they occupy less space while making it clearer that they have
  a popdown menu to select their build target.

NF-60-M625-005 GPS: approximate search (2013-06-25)

  GPS is now able to do approximate search. For instance, searching for
  "saerch" will also match "search" when this mode is activated.

NF-60-M621-005 GPS: new plugin formatfile.py (2013-06-21)

  This plugin, when loaded, adds a new menu "/Edit/Format Whole File",
  which reformats the whole file while preserving the current cursor
  location.

NF-60-M620-018 GPS: color schemes (2013-06-20)

  A new preference is available to select color schemes. This affects other
  preferences and can be used to set dark colors for the background of
  editors and windows.

NF-60-M617-030 GPS: apply preferences on the fly (2013-06-17)

  The "Apply" button has been removed from the preferences dialog.
  Changes are now applied on the fly as settings are modified.

NF-60-M606-028 GPS: remove Open From Project dialog (2013-06-07)

  The menu "/Files/Open From Project" no longer opens a dialog. Instead,
  it moves the focus to the global search field. The global search field
  offers many additional features.

NF-60-M603-060 GPS: remove Goto Entity dialog (2013-06-07)

  The menu "/Navigate/Goto Entity" no longer opens up a dialog. Instead it
  moves the focus to the global search field. The "/Tools/Views/Entity"
  view was also removed since its features are now available through the
  global search field.

NF-60-M531-036 GPS: tooltips for SPARK 2014 and Ada 2012 aspects (2013-08-03)

  Ada 2012 and SPARK 2014 aspects are now displayed in tooltips.

NF-60-M531-032 SPARK 2014 support (2013-07-30)

  The SPARK 2014 toolset is now supported by both GPS and GNATbench.  A
  Prove menu will be available if the SPARK 2014 toolset is installed and
  found on the PATH at start up.

NF-60-M530-024 GPS: only save changed preferences (2013-07-04)

  GPS will now only save those preferences that have been modified in
  its HOME/.gps/preferences.xml file. This change should be mostly invisible
  to users, except when changing versions of GPS where the new default
  will be picked up automatically.

NF-60-M529-012 GPS: execute_extended.py plugin removed (2013-05-29)

  This plugin allowed executing any of the GPS commands via the
  keyboard. This behavior is now directly available via the new global
  search box in the GPS toolbar.

NF-60-M524-041 Improved indentation of parenthesized expressions (2013-06-20)

  Extra spaces following an open parenthesis are now taken into account
  when indenting Ada code.

NF-60-M523-031 GPS: add search field in the global toolbar (2013-05-27)

  A search field is now provided, which will display search results from a
  variety of contexts (e.g., source file names, entities, GPS actions,
  build targets, and open windows).

NF-60-M424-019 Improved indentation of conditional expressions (2013-05-17)

  Ada 2012 if-expressions and case-expressions are handled better by the
  indentation engine. Extra indentation levels are used for each case branch.

NF-60-M411-022 GPS: Aliases expansion directly in editor (2013-06-01)

  The aliases expansion feature now works directly in the editor, without
  any dialog for aliases with parameters. The user progresses through the
  fields directly in the editor via the Ctrl+Tab shortcut. Visual
  feedback is provided for the current field via highlighting.

NF-60-M403-003 WB: Wind River Workbench 3.2 support (2013-04-11)

  Wind River Workbench 3.2.x support is restored installing a new dedicated
  feature.

NF-60-M329-013 GPS: translucent highlighting colors (2013-03-29)

  It is now possible to specify translucent colors for highlighting of things
  like error messages and current lines in the editors.

NF-60-M318-031 GB: warning editing files not part of a GB project (2013-05-13)

  When the Ada editor opens a file not part of a GNATbench project, a dialog is
  displayed to inform the user that some features will not work properly until
  the file is part of a GNATbench project.
  This dialog can be disabled through the Ada Editor Preferences page.

NF-60-M315-025 WB: enable DFW_ENABLE_ADA_SYMBOL_CHECK at startup (2013-05-17)

  On Wind River Workbench 3.3 or later, the Ada expressions watch feature
  requires the DFW_ENABLE_ADA_SYMBOL_CHECK environment variable to be set to 1.
  If not set, the Expressions view is not able to display current values of
  record and array variables.
  This feature can be disabled using the Ada General preferences page.

NF-60-M307-008 GPS: refactoring of highlighter.py (2013-03-27)

  This Python module is used as the basis for all Python scripts that need to
  highlight text in editors. In particular, you can easily extend it to
  highlight specific text or regular expressions in your buffer. This script
  now provides an OverlayStyle class, which supports more properties than
  before. Now you can strike through or underline specific text in your editors
  with just a few lines of code.

NF-60-M301-031 New review classification of CodePeer messages (2013-06-13)

  When doing a manual review of a CodePeer message, the user can no longer
  change the message ranking, but instead can specify a review
  classification and the name of the reviewer. A new message review dialog
  is added and a new filter was added for CodePeer Report view to manage
  visibility of messages by review status.

NF-60-M218-036 GPS: GPS.MDI.add to put on top of consoles (2013-06-07)

  The Python function GPS.MDI.add now has additional parameters to specify
  the initial location of the new widget. This allows you to put widgets on
  top of the existing GPS consoles.

NF-60-M205-030 ECL: navigation problems are announced (2013-05-24)

  Navigation functions like hyperlinks and goto spec/body won't work if
  sources are not compiled or if foreign Ada source files are used. Dialog
  boxes (which can be disabled using a checkbox) will pop up to display
  warnings and errors.

NF-60-M204-035 ECL: automatic scenario set for Android projects (2013-02-04)

  When the New Project wizard creates a new Ada for Android project,
  the "OS" scenario variable will be set to "linux" automatically.
  This setting is essential for creating proper library names for subsequent
  use by the Android OS.

NF-60-M129-023 GPS: simplified CodePeer report window (2013-03-11)

  The CodePeer report window has been simplified to improve usability and
  remove unneeded information. Access to the various filters is also
  improved.

NF-60-M129-002 GPS: return block completion (2013-02-04)

  Add "return ... end return;" statement support for block completion.

NF-60-M124-022 GPS: preserve location in new views (2013-06-06)

  When creating a new view for an editor (for instance through drag-and-drop),
  the new view is now displayed at the same location as the original editor,
  rather than on the first line.

NF-60-M122-025 GPS: filter in the outline view (2013-01-23)

  A filter has been added to the Outline view to make it easier to find
  entities.

NF-60-M121-011 GPS: Outline has a flat view mode (2013-01-21)

  It is now possible to display all entities at the same level, rather than
  nested hierarchically. In some cases, it makes searching for an entity
  easier.

NF-60-M111-033 GPS: Refill automatically computes paragraph (2013-01-11)

  The menu "/Edit/Selection/Refill" will now either apply to the current
  selection if it exists (as before) or automatically compute the extent
  of the current paragraph to reformat (instead of only applying to the
  current line).

NF-60-M110-025 GPS: group spec and body in Outline view (2013-01-10)

  It is now possible to group the spec and body (or spec and full view) for
  an entity on the same row in the Outline view to reduce the total height
  of the Outline view. Clicking on the name of the entity will jump to its
  spec, but if this is already the current location, the editor will jump
  to its body instead.

NF-60-M109-036 GPS: autofix on missing constant with preferences (2013-01-21)

  Autofix has always done fixes using lower-cased letters. This enhancement
  performs the fixes on missing constants following the user defined
  preferences specified in "Preferences/Editor/Ada/Reserved word casing".

NF-60-M108-041 GPS: line wrapping in Messages window (2013-01-09)

  It is now possible to configure whether the Messages window should wrap
  lines or require horizontal scrolling.

NF-60-M102-006 GPS: move Serialize to /Edit/Rectangle/ (2013-01-11)

  This menu was previously in "/Edit/Selection", but is more logically in
  the Rectangle submenu since it conceptually applies to a rectangle.

NF-60-LC21-017 GPS: Update to Scenario View (2013-01-08)

  The Scenario view has been updated to a better looking tree rendering.

NF-60-LC17-029 GPS: use separate file for CodePeer's audit data (2013-09-16)

  CodePeer's audit data for messages is stored in a separate file to improve
  performance on subsequent GPS invocations.

NF-60-LC06-024 GPS: Locations view has a toolbar (2012-12-06)

  Actions such as "clear locations" and the filter panel are now present in
  the view's toolbar to make them more accessible. The preference "Auto Jump
  To First Location" was removed from the preferences menu and moved to the
  toolbar as well.

NF-60-LC06-015 GPS: tab menu allows easy selection of open tabs (2012-12-17)

  The right-click menu on notebook tabs now shows the list of all windows open
  in those tabs, which ease navigation.

NF-60-LC03-011 GPS: local toolbars for views (2012-12-03)

  A number of views now have a local toolbar. They also display their
  configuration settings in a local menu rather than in the Preferences
  dialog or the contextual menu.

NF-60-LB29-021 GPS: remove status bar (2012-11-29)

  The status bar has been removed. It was only used to display the current
  tasks in progress.  The corresponding progress bars were moved to the
  right of the toolbar, replacing the throbber.

NF-60-LB29-006 GPS: use ellipsis in window titles (2012-11-28)

  The text in title bars and in the notebook tabs will now use ellipsis
  ("...") when the window is too small to accomodate the entire text. The
  size of notebook tabs is also limited so we do not end up with a single
  tab using most of the notebook width, thus hiding the others. This
  behavior is controlled by a new preference "Window/Homogeneous Tabs".

NF-60-LB28-008 GPS: progress bar when running gps_codepeer_bridge (2013-08-08)

  After running CodePeer, gps_codepeer_bridge is launched to load messages.
  This can take a long time on large sources. A progress bar is now displayed
  during this phase to provide feedback to the user.

NF-60-LB26-025 GPS: clickable qualified name in editor status bars (2012-12-13)

  The name of the current subprogram, as displayed in the editor status bar,
  now includes the name of the enclosing subprograms and packages. Each of
  these names is clickable to easily jump to the beginning of the enclosing
  block.

NF-60-LB20-022 GPS: Key shortcuts dialog display improved (2012-11-21)

  The display of the key shortcuts in this dialog now matches what is
  done for the top-level menus, using symbols like up arrow for the shift
  key, a caret sign for the control key, and the special symbols for
  Mac keyboards.

NF-60-LB15-037 GPS: EditorOverlay can now highlight a whole line (2012-12-05)

  The EditorOverlay class can now be used in Python plugins to highlight an
  entire line, through the property "paragraph-background":
    # Create an overlay for an editor:
    b = GPS.EditorBuffer.get(GPS.File ("my_file.adb"))
    o = b.create_overlay("my_overlay_name")

    # Set the paragraph-background property to pink
    o.set_property ("paragraph-background", "#f0c0c0")

    # This highlights the entire line 317 in my file
    b.apply_overlay (o,
       GPS.EditorLocation(b, 317, 1),
       GPS.EditorLocation(b, 317, 1))

NF-60-LB04-004 GB: Export GNATbench preferences like CDT (2013-01-22)

  GNATbench preferences can now be exported via the export preferences wizard
  and imported into another workspace via the import preferences wizard.

NF-60-LA05-038 GPS: Key shortcut for "Locate in Project View" (2013-10-01)

  A new action, "Locate file in explorer", is available for key shortcuts
  and scripting.

NF-60-L926-027 GPS: Project, File, and Window view tooltips (2012-11-13)

  Tooltips have been added to views to help navigation when windows are narrow.

NF-60-L921-032 GPS: Show protected objects in Outline view (2012-10-16)

  Protected and task types/objects and their entries are now visible in the
  Outline View. A new filter in Outline View "Show tasks, entries, and
  protected types" is used to show/hide these items.

NF-60-L530-025 New cross reference engine (2013-01-24)

  GPS and GNATbench both have a new cross referencing engine based on SQLite.
  This new engine is expected to bring extra performance -- the xref database
  is now persistent across sessions and GPS will no longer need to parse ALI
  files on the fly. The new engine is also expected to provide more stability,
  since an external process is used to fill the database.

NF-60-L510-040 GPS: search in the current selection (2013-01-31)

  GPS can now limit Find and Replace operations to the currently selected
  text. This is done by selecting the scope "Current Selection" in the
  Search dialog; this scope is automatically selected when launching the
  dialog while a selection exists in the current editor.

NF-60-J728-022 GPS: the Project Wizard takes advantage of gnatname (2012-11-08)

  The project wizard now optionally uses gnatname to search for Ada units in
  files with non-standard naming conventions.

NF-60-I430-029 GB: Show Ada content in Project Explorer view (2013-03-28)

  GNATbench now uses the Project Explorer view rather than the now deprecated
  GNAT Project Explorer view.  This is the standard view in Eclipse for viewing
  projects, folders, and files.  There's also a new view filter that can hide
  any folders/files that are not relevant to the current build configuration.
  Working sets are supported now as well.

NF-60-I424-031 GB: Ada elements now displayed in Properties view (2013-04-22)

  When any element contributed to the Project Explorer or Outline view by
  GNATbench is selected, you will now see properties of that element in the
  Properties view.

NF-60-I320-015 GB: Enhance block completions (2013-01-25)

  The block completion facility has been extended to cover additional
  constructs, e.g. extended return statements, protected entry bodies,
  and variant parts inside record declarations.

NF-60-H605-006 GPS: Visual indication of completions visibility (2013-04-16)

  In smart completions, entities that are not visible in the current scope
  are now displayed in grey.

NF-60-H603-006 GPS: Aliases auto completion (2013-04-11)

  Aliases can now be completed and expanded by the regular auto-completion
  mechanism.

NF-60-G104-002 WB: Debug tooltip (2013-05-16)

  When debugging an Ada application, if the mouse cursor hoveers over a
  variable that can be printed by the debugger, the tooltip displays the
  variable's current value. This feature requires Wind River Workbench 3.3 or
  later.
