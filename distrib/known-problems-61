KP-61-NA09-055 GPS: replace all not working with overlapped matches

  Problem:    When there are overlapped matches in search Replace All could
              make changes not expected by the user, because it replaces only
              last match from sequence of overlapped matches.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2 on 2014-10-15

  Workaround: Use Replace & Find to replace each needed occurrence manually.
