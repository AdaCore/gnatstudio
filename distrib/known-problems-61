Known problems fixed in GPS 6.2 / GNATbench 2.10
------------------------------------------------

KP-61-O522-003 GPS: incorrect indentation after case expression

  Problem:    When 'Case indentation' is set to 'RM_Style' code after case
              expression is indented incorrectly.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2 on 2015-05-27

  Workaround: Use another value for 'Case indentation' preference.

KP-61-O506-020 GPS: project attributes for CodePeer

  Problem:    GPS ignores some project attributes for CodePeer.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2 on 2015-05-12

  Workaround: Use text editor to edit project file when CodePeer package is
              used in it.

KP-61-O429-016 GPS: behaviors of local toolbar menus

  Problem:    The menus at the right of the view-local toolbars behave
              differently to the rest of the menus. In particular, it may
              happen that the menu stays open, but hidden behind the main
              window.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2 on 2015-05-07

  Workaround: Move the main window and click on the menu to make it
              disappear.

KP-61-O423-026 GPS: issue displaying complex objects in the debugger

  Problem:    Sometimes a graphical displaying of complex object does not work
              during debugging in GPS. As result, an incorrect representation
              of the object is displayed and a CONSTRAINT_ERROR is reported in
              the GPS log file.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2 on 2015-05-01

  Workaround: Use 'print'in the debugger console instead.

KP-61-O421-010 GPS: call tree not refreshed after xref recomputed

  Problem:    When querying a call tree for an entity before the
              cross-references are available, the entry appears as empty
              in the call tree, and is not refreshed when re-querying
              once the cross-references are available.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2 on 2015-04-22

  Workaround: Clear the call tree manually.

KP-61-O415-004 GPS: Cross-references disabled when traces.cfg not found

  Problem:     When the file traces.cfg is not found in the GPS config
               directory (~/.gps or %USERPROFILE%\.gps), gnatinspect is not
               spawned and cross-references are disabled

  Status:      This was fixed in 6.2 on 2015-04-16

  Workaround:  Recreate a traces.cfg file that only contains a "+" on a line
               of its own.

KP-61-O403-018 GPS: "Whole word" option in omni-search is insensitive

  Problem:    The whole word option for the omni-search is only applicable
              when searching on regular expressions. But it is visible at
              all times, and can even be interacted with initially even when
              the "Fuzzy search" mode is used.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2 on 2015-04-10

  Workaround: Ignore this option unless searching for regular expressions.

KP-61-O327-016 GPS: crash on computing blocks

  Problem:    On very specific (and incorrect) code structures, the editor
              would crash while attempting to recompute blocks.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2 on 2015-04-13

  Workaround: None

KP-61-O325-029 GPS: cancel when defining new key binding

  Problem:     When user starts defining new key binding in 'Key Shortcuts'
               dialog and closes the dialog before key is assigned, GPS
               crashes or becomes unstable.

  Status:      This was fixed in 6.2 on 2015-03-31

  Workaround:  Make sure you cancel defining new key binding before closing
               'Key Shortcuts' dialog.

KP-61-O323-029 GPS: "locate in project view" does not clear filters

  Problem:    When using the contextual menu "locate in project view" on
              a file, filters being applied on the Project View can keep
              the file hidden, causing another item to be selected instead.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2 on 2015-03-23

  Workaround: Clear filters on the Project View before using the menu.

KP-61-O316-020 GPS: Directories shown in omnisearch

  Problem:    In the omnisearch, when searching for files, the omnisearch would
              display directories, but clicking on them would trigger an error

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2 on 2015-04-10

  Workaround: Don't click on directories in the omnisearch

KP-61-O308-004 GPS: annoyance when clicking on lock icon in editors

  Problem:    Editors display two icons in their status bar: a lock to make
              the file read-only, and an icon showing the VCS status. The
              latter is displayed slightly later, and this moves the lock
              icon aside. Trying to click on the lock icon before the VCS
              icon is displayed could result in clicking on the VCS icon
              instead if it happens to be made visible just at that point.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2 on 2015-03-09

  Workaround: Wait for the VCS icon to be visible.

KP-61-O305-028 GPS: auto-indent fails with access procedure formal parameter

  Problem:    When a generic packages takes an access to a procedure as a
              formal parameter, GPS indentation fails for the rest of the
              file.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2 on 2015-03-16

  Workaround: It is often better to use an actual procedure rather than an
              access to procedure as a formal parameter. This leads to more
              efficient code.

KP-61-O302-020 GPS: project view not refreshed when view filter cleared

  Problem:    Changing Project View options when some filter is applied
              could result in incorrect content of project view or even
              in GPS hang. One of possible glitch is that Project View
              stays empty after cleaning filter.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2 on 2015-03-11

  Workaround: Clear filter before changing Project View options.

KP-61-O228-001 GPS: targets with mode 'Manually' launch without dialog

  Problem:    The build targets which have launch mode 'Manually' launch
              without a dialog when invoked from the global menu, instead
              of presenting the command line dialog.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2 on 2015-03-03

  Workaround: Switch the target to mode "Manually with dialog".

KP-61-O227-005 GPS: Align command depends on auto-indent preference

  Problem:    The Align contextual menu does not work if the auto-indentation
              is set to 'None'.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2 on 2015-03-04

  Workaround: Delete lines with 'indent' call in align.py file.

KP-61-O222-001 GPS: leftover highlighting from auto_highlight_occurrences

  Problem:    When the auto_highlight_occurrences plugin is active, stray
              highlighting may remain in the buffer after cursor move.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2 on 2015-03-04

  Workaround: Close and reopen the file editor.

KP-61-O213-020 GPS: renamed action in eclipse.py

  Problem:    The eclipse.py provides an action that deletes all the lines
              that are at least partially selected. This action was named
              "delete line", which created a conflict with a similar built-in
              action, so it was renamed to "delete selected lines". You
              might need to update your key shortcuts.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2 on 2015-02-13

  Workaround: eclipse.py is not loaded by default. When you load it, you
              are getting an error message in the GPS Message view, which
              can be safely ignored.

KP-61-O208-003 Cross-references not working with aggregate library projects

  Problem:    GPS and GB ignore the cross-reference information generated by
              the compiler in the projects aggregated in an aggregate
              library project.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2 on 2015-04-02

  Workaround: One solution is to have a second set of project files that are
              only used to load in GPS and do the cross-references, where
              aggregate library projects are replaced with standard projects.

KP-61-O202-046 GPS: can't find coverage data from an extended project

  Problem:    GPS is unable to find coverage data when the project
              tree contains extended and aggregate projects.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2 on 2015-04-20

  Workaround: Copy coverage data manually into directory where GPS expects it.

KP-61-O120-033 GPS: auto-casing in comments

  Problem:    It sometimes happens that GPS ends up in an incorrect mode
              where all words in a comment are capitalized as you type.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2 on 2015-01-28

  Workaround: Close the editor and reopen it.

KP-61-O120-002 GPS: cannot force background color for editors

  Problem:    The python method GPS.Editor.set_background_color has no
              effect (and neither does the colors.py example which shows
              how to show the background color of editors based on their
              extension).

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.0 on 2015-01-20

  Workaround: None, the colors are hard-coded in Ada.

KP-61-O116-007 GPS: selecting -gnatp automatically adds -gnatVn

  Problem:    In the Project Properties dialog, adding the "Suppress All
              Checks" as a switch for the Ada sources adds both -gnatp
              and -gnatVn on the command line. Although this is correct
              (since in the compiler -gnatp automatically also disables
              validity checks), this was also a bit confusing.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.0 on 2015-02-04

  Workaround: Leave both switches, or manually remove -gnatVn if you
              prefer. The behavior of the compiler is the same in both
              cases.

KP-61-O116-005 GPS: check box state inverted by multiple clicks

  Problem:    The "three-state" checkboxes in the Project Properties dialog
              and in the build target settings dialog has an invalid
              representation: instead of having three states (on, off and
              default), it switches between 6 states.

  Status:     This is fixed in 6.2 on 2015-05-15

  Workaround: Ignore the visual representation of check box. Verify the
              textual form of the command line in the switches dialog to
              get correct the value of the switch setting.

KP-61-O113-020 GPS: build targets refer to "gnatmake"

  Problem:    Some GPS build targets (such as "Check syntax") still invoke
              gnatmake instead of the more modern gprbuild.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.0 on 2015-01-22

  Workaround: Use the Target Configuration dialog to change manually the
              targets to use "%builder" instead of "%gnatmake".

KP-61-O112-033 GNATdoc: fail when project file is symbolic link

  Problem:    GNATdoc fails when the project file is a symbolic link to a
              regular file.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.0 on 2015-01-14

  Workaround: Copy the project file to a regular file and pass its name to
              GNATdoc.

KP-61-NC12-038 GPS: find/replace in current selection does not work

  Problem:    The function Replace All in "Current Selection" scope could
              cause as replacement in an incorrect text position, or no
              replacement at all.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.0 on 2015-01-12

  Workaround: Use the "Replace & Find" button and select occurrences manually.

KP-61-NB27-029 GPS: floating window could be restored on second monitor

  Problem:    GPS stores the position of floating windows when they are closed
              so that it can restore that position the next time the window is
              opened. However, that position could be on another monitor,
              which on some systems (OSX for instance) makes the window
              invisible and impossible to manipulate.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.0 on 2014-11-27

  Workaround: After opening the window, select /Window/Floating to move it
              back to the GPS main window.

KP-61-NB26-010 GB: Cannot watch global variables defined in package body.

  Problem:    When selecting an expression that contains variable(s) defined in
              the package body, the expression displayed in the Add Watch
              Expression dialog doesn't add the package prefix.
              This problem also affects the tooltip feature. The current value
              of the pointed variable is not displayed by the tooltip.

              When the selection boundary is not at an identifier boundary or
              the selection is empty, the watch expression is incorrect.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10.0 on 2014-11-27

  Workaround: Edit the expression manually.

KP-61-NB19-029 GPS: frequent disk accesses while moving cursor in editors

  Problem:    Whenever the cursor moves in the editor, GPS recomputes some
              information about the current location, which might result in
              frequent disk accesses. On slower machines, this might slow down
              GPS.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.0 on 2015-01-06

  Workaround: This is hardly noticeable on most machines.

KP-61-NB12-012 GPS: incorrect gnat driver for gnatstub and gnatmetric

  Problem:    GPS does not use the proper cross driver (<target>-gnat) when
              launching gnat stub for generating bodies and gnat metric for
              computing metrics.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.0 on 2014-12-11

  Workaround: Launch the tools manually.

KP-61-NB10-016 GPS: corrupt notebook tabs when reordering

  Problem:    When using the mouse to reorder editors within a notebook, and
              then dragging the editor to some other place, it is possible
              that the display gets corrupted.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.0 on 2015-01-13

  Workaround: When this happens, you can still select editors with the
              /Windows menu for instance. Or restart GPS to refresh the GUI.

KP-61-NB07-018 GPS: filter menus do not stay visible on screen

  Problem:    When clicking in one of the filters boxes (in the Outline,
              Locations or Project views for instance), the menu appears and
              immediately disappears (on some systems) when the mouse button
              is released.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.0 on 2015-03-11

  Workaround: Keep the button pressed while selecting options in the menu.

KP-61-N930-046 GPS: Debuggee still running after debugger terminated

  Problem:    When closing a debugger session, if the program being debugged
              was running, it might continue to run even after the debugger
              has been terminated.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.0 on 2014-11-12

  Workaround: Interrupt the program before closing the debugger.

KP-61-N822-004 GPS: Input focus when creating/opening new windows

  Problem:    After switching from a floating windows to a non-floating one
              using keyboard shortcuts, GPS keeps the focus in the floating
              window.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.0 on 2014-12-03

  Workaround: Use the mouse or Windows Manager shortcuts to switch between
              windows.

Known problems fixed in GPS 6.1.2 / GNATbench 2.9.2
---------------------------------------------------

KP-61-O512-001 WB: building VxWorks 653 project for simpc not documented.

  Problem:    Missing documentation in "Creating and Building a VxWorks 653
              Integration Project" tutorial for the simpc platform.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9.2 on 2015-05-20

  Workaround: The example to use is located at
              share/examples/i586-wrs-vxworksae/Workbench/apex_raven/config
              Change imported module.xml file to use the "simpc" platform.
              When changing the "BINDING" scenario variable, change also the
              "PLATFORM" scenario variable to "i586-wrs-vxworksae". You can
              select environment or project specific scope when setting the
              variables.
              See also Known problem O223-046.

KP-61-O430-006 GB: codepeer details report empty

  Problem:    For very large projects, more than 100,000 lines of code
              after running Codepeer, the CodePeer Problem Details view
              is empty.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9.2 on 2015-01-30

  Workaround: See the html files in the Codepeer project.output/html
              directory using native browser.

KP-61-O424-012 GB: IDE'Xref_Database attribute not supported in GPR file

  Problem:    GPR files defining in the IDE package the Xref_Database
              attribute are not supported. They generates undefined attribute
              "xref_database" error in GPR file. These GNAT projects are not
              supported by GNATbench.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9.2 on 2015-05-18

  Workaround: Remove the IDE'Xref_Database attribute and restart GNATbench.

KP-61-O415-010 GB: access check failed reported in toolchains.adb

  Problem:    Sometimes, when loading, cleaning or building a project, an error
              "toolchains.adb:661 access check failed" is displayed in an
              error dialog or found in the error log.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9.2 on 2015-03-13

  Workaround: Remove the incorrect toolchain usage from the .gb_project file
              of the eclipse project that generated the error.
              Note: .gb_project files are not displayed by default in the
              "Project Explorer" view. Please uncheck ".* resources" filter
              using "Customize View..." item of the "Project Explorer"'s view
              menu (Ctrl+F10 from Project Explorer view)

KP-61-O408-005 GB: Build All command starts multiple times the same build.

  Problem:     When the workspace contains GNAT projects automatically created
               during an existing GNAT project import operation, sometimes
               when running the Build All (Ctrl+B) command, GNATbench starts
               multiple jobs building the same GNAT project.

  Status:      This was fixed in 2.9.2 on 2015-04-22

  Workaround:  Disable the GNATbench builder for all non root GNAT project.
               - To verify the a GNAT project is not a root project, use the
               GNATbench properties page of the project properties dialog.
               - To disable the GNATbench builder, uncheck it in the Builders
               page of the project properties dialog.

KP-61-O223-046 WB: error in building VxWorks 653 integration project tutorial

  Problem:    When running the "Creating and Building a VxWorks 653
              Integration Project" tutorial on VxWorks 653 2.4 for a
              powerpc-wrs-vxworksae target, the projects cannot be created, and
              error dialogs are displayed.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9.2 on 2015-03-26

  Workaround: Edit the imported module.xml file, in CoreOS definition use the
              wrSbcP4080 board support package (BSP) instead of wrSbc750gx.
              If building the sender/receiver projects, you encounter gprconfig
              problems, remove the c & c++ languages from the gprconfig command
              line present in their generated gnat.makefile files.

KP-61-O223-001 WB: scenario.makefile not created when converting to ada project

  Problem:    Sometimes, when converting a Wind River Workbench project to an
              Ada project, the scenario.makefile is not created, and thus the
              converted project cannot be built. This occurs when the external
              gpr file used during the conversion contains unsupported IDE
              package. When it occurs, the Error Log contains multiple
              GNATbench errors.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9.2 on 2015-03-13

  Workaround: Use during the conversion a modified gpr file without its
              original IDE package. After the conversion, restore the IDE
              package to its original state.

KP-61-O204-044 GB: comment between 'null' and ')' in subprogram definition

  Problem:    Having in a subprogram definition (specification or body) the
              last parameter default value equal to 'null' and having a
              comment between this 'null' default value and the ')' character
              closing the parameters list, generates unhandled ada exceptions
              in ada_analyzer package, and brakes tooltips & code assist
              feature.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9.2 on 2015-02-11

  Workaround: Move the comment before the last parameter, or use a constant
              instead of 'null' to set the default value.
              ex: MY_TYPE_NULL_DEFAULT_VALUE : constant My_Type := null;
              Restart the Eclipse or Workbench platform.

KP-61-O204-017 GB: random crash after code assist popup display

  Problem:    After code assist popup was displayed to propose possible
              completions, Eclipse/Workbench sometimes crashes.

  Workaround:  Right click project, then properties, then Gnatbench
               properties and touch something(e.g. deselect root project),
               APPLY, select is root project, hit OK. This will create
               the necessary files.

KP-61-N717-017 GB: Detect the nature of the project at import

  Problem:     When using WRWB and git repository to check out WR DKM/RTP
               projects, sometimes the gnat.makefle and
               scenario.makefile are not created as expected.

  Status:      This is fixed in 2.9.2 on 2015-04-28.

  Workaround:  Right click project, then properties, then Gnatbench
               properties and touch something(e.g. deselect root project),
               APPLY, select is root project, hit OK. This will create
               the necessary files. Also restarting WRWB or opening a
               closed project will auto-generate the missing gnat.makefile.

  Problem:    When using delete at the end of the file, or backspace at the
              beginning of the file, GPS should do nothing, but instead does
              delete a character in the wrong direction.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1.1 on 2014-11-13

  Workaround: Don't use delete operations at beginning/end of file

KP-61-NB05-034 GPS: not reusing existing editor

  Problem:    In some cases, GPS does not reuse an existing editor for a file,
              but instead opens a new editor. This leads to confusion. This
              seems to happen mostly when creating and saving new files.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1.1 on 2014-11-06

  Workaround: After saving a new file, close the editor and reopen it.

KP-61-NA31-056 WB: Cannot edit GNAT project properties through the GPS dialog

  Problem:    When the debugger refreshes the contents of the data window,
              some values are left highlighted in red as if they had just
              been modified, even when they were modified during some previous
              step.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1.1 on 2014-11-05

  Workaround: This only impact the colors, the actual values are correct.

KP-61-NA17-042 WB: SIGSEGV crash when opening large programs

  Problem:    Opening a large GNAT project in Wind River Workbench, generates
              a Java Virtual Machine crash in GNATbench library native code.
              Deleting the generated b__prj_main ada file allows to restart
              Wind River Workbench.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9.1 on 2014-11-18

  Workaround: Add in eclipse/workbench ini file a -Xss (ex: -Xss1M) vmargs
              option to set larger thread stack size.

KP-61-N604-003 GPS: scroll bars not displayed in editors

  Problem:    After restarting GPS some windows do not have scrollbars, but
              the text is positioned in a such way that the top part of the
              file is above the top of the editor window. This prevents normal
              navigation it the file.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1.1 on 2014-11-19

  Workaround: Close and reopen the editor.
