Known problems fixed in GPS 6.2 / GNATbench 2.10
------------------------------------------------

KP-61-NB26-010 GB: Cannot watch global variables defined in package body.

  Problem:    When selecting an expression that contains variable(s) defined in
              package body, the expression displayed in the Add Watch
              Expression dialog doesn't add the package prefix.
              This problem affects also the tooltip feature. The current value
              of the pointed variable is not displayed by the tooltip.

              When the selection boundary is not at an identifier boundary or
              the selection length is equal to 0, the watch expression is
              incorrect.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10.0 on 2014-11-27

  Workaround: Edit the expression manually.

KP-61-NB12-012 GPS: incorrect gnat driver for gnatstub and gnatmetric

  Problem:    GPS does not use the proper cross driver (<target>-gnat) when
              launching gnat stub for generating bodies and gnat metric for
              computing metrics.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.0 on 2014-12-11

  Workaround: Launch the tools manually.

KP-61-N930-046 GPS: Debuggee still running after debugger terminated

  Problem:    When closing a debugger session, if the program being debugged
              was running, it might continue to run even after the debugger
              has been terminated.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.0 on 2014-11-12

  Workaround: Interrupt the program before closing the debugger.

KP-61-N822-004 GPS: Input focus when creating/opening new windows

  Problem:    After switching from floating windows to non-floating one using
              keyboard shortcuts GPS keeps focus in the floating window.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.0 on 2014-12-03

  Workaround: Use mouse or Windows Manager shortcuts to switch windows.

Known problems fixed in GPS 6.1.1 / GNATbench 2.9.1
---------------------------------------------------

KP-61-NC04-017 GPS: prevent_project_edition.py need update for menu name

  Problem:    Enabling prevent_project_edition.py plug-in causes an error
              on GPS start up.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1.1 on 2014-12-05

  Workaround: Fix menu names in prevent_project_edition.py.

KP-61-NC03-015 WB: white lines in the Wind River Workbench Build Targets tree

  Problem:    In the Project Explorer view, a lot of nodes with no labels are
              displayed in the Build Targets tree of any Wind River Workbench
              projects.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9.1 on 2014-12-18

  Workaround: None.

KP-61-NC01-048 GB: Ada 2102 reserved word "some" not displayed as a keyword.

  Problem:    Ada 2012 reserved word "some" is not displayed in AdaCore's Ada
              Editor as an Ada keyword. It is displayed as an identifier.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9.1 on 2014-12-19

KP-61-NC01-009 GPS: unreadable fonts under Solaris

  Problem:    Under Solaris 10, the fonts might be unreadable or render
              with all characters replaced by a square.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1.1 on 2014-01-02

  Workaround: in the GPS installation, edit the file etc/fonts/fonts.conf.
              After line 26, add the following two lines:
                <dir>/usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi</dir>

KP-61-NB18-009 GB: Cannot open Ada Editor.

  Problem:    Sometimes opening Ada editor fails. The Ada editor could not be
              initialized because of a NullPointerException. Once it occurs
              the file cannot be edited anymore by the Ada editor.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9.1 on 2014-12-18

  Workaround: Edit the file using the standard text editor or restart
              GNATbench.

KP-61-NB12-023 ECL: Cannot set breakpoints on Eclipse Luna

  Problem:    On Eclipse 4.4, when debugging an Ada Application (menu Debug As
              => Ada Application) no breakpoints can be set.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9.1 on 2014-12.18

  Workaround: Launch debugger using Debug As => C/C++ Application menu. Set
              Ada Event Breakpoints using the GDB console view.

KP-61-NB11-004 GPS: emacs key shortcuts lost

  Problem:    If you had enabled the emacs.py plugin in GPS 6.0.2 or earlier,
              the key shortcuts were lost in the transition to GPS 6.1.0.
              We now provide a dummy emacs.py to help with the transition

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1.1 on 2014-12-11

  Workaround: Go to /Edit/Key Shortcuts to enable the Emacs shortcuts.

KP-61-NB10-025 GPS: problems when clicking on Ada files outside of GPS

  Problem:    Under Windows, when clicking on Ada files in the Windows explorer
              to open GPS, a window might pop up saying:
              "There was a problem sending the command to the program".

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1.1 on 2014-12-08

  Workaround: Open the file from within a running GPS.

KP-61-NB10-019 GB: Cannot analyze file or projects sources

  Problem:    A Problem Occured error box is displayed when running the
              "Analyze Ada File" or "Analyze Project Sources" actions.
              The problem details contains the following message:
              Build_Configurations.Mode_Map.Element: key not in map

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9.1 on 2014-12-18

  Workaround: Use compile or build actions to run the analyze.

KP-61-NB06-027 GPS: Delete ops not working correctly at beginning/end of file

  Problem:    When using Suppr at the end of the file, or backspace at the
              beginning of the file, GPS should have done nothing, but instead
              did delete a char in the wrong direction

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1.1 on 2014-11-13

  Workaround: Don't use delete operations at beginning/end of file

KP-61-NB05-034 GPS: not reusing existing editor

  Problem:    In some cases, GPS does not reuse an existing editor for a file,
              but instead opens a new editor. This leads to confusion. This
              seems to happen mostly when creating and saving new files.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1.1 on 2014-11-06

  Workaround: After saving a new file, close the editor and reopen it.

KP-61-NA31-056 WB: Cannot edit GNAT project properties through GPS dialog

  Problem:    When running GNAT Project => Edit Properties menu, the GPS
              project properties dialog is not displayed.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9.1 on 2014-12-01

  Workaround: Use the GPR file test editor, or edit externally the GPR file
              using GPS.

KP-61-NA27-039 GPS: incorrect highlight of changed value in debugger data

  Problem:    When the debugger refreshes the contents of the data window,
              some values are left highlighted in red as if they had just
              been modified, even when they were modified during some previous
              step.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1.1 on 2014-11-05

  Workaround: This only impact the colors, the actual values are correct.

KP-61-NA17-042 WB: SIGSEGV crash when opening large programs

  Problem:    Opening a large GNAT project in Wind River Workbench, generates
              a Java Virtual Machine crash in GNATbench library native code.
              Deleting the generated b__prj_main ada file allows to restart
              Wind River Workbench.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.9.1 on 2014-11-18

  Workaround: Add in eclipse/workbench ini file a -Xss (ex: -Xss1M) vmargs
              option to set larger thread stack size.

KP-61-N604-003 GPS: scroll bars not displayed in editors

  Problem:    After restarting GPS some windows do not have scrollbars, but
              the text is positioned in a such way that the top part of the
              file is above the top of the editor window. This prevents normal
              navigation it the file.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1.1 on 2014-11-19

  Workaround: Close and reopen the editor.
