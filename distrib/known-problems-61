Known problems fixed in GPS 6.2 / GNATbench 2.10
------------------------------------------------

KP-61-N930-046 GPS: Debuggee still running after debugger terminated

  Problem:    When closing a debugger session, if the program being debugged
              was running, it might continue to run even after the debugger
              has been terminated.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.2.0 on 2014-11-12

  Workaround: Interrupt the program before closing the debugger.

Known problems fixed in GPS 6.1.1
---------------------------------

KP-61-NB06-027 GPS: Delete ops not working correctly at beginning/end of file

  Problem:    When using Suppr at the end of the file, or backspace at the
              beginning of the file, GPS should have done nothing, but instead
              did delete a char in the wrong direction

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1.1 on 2014-11-13

  Workaround: Don't use delete operations at beginning/end of file

KP-61-NB05-034 GPS: not reusing existing editor

  Problem:    In some cases, GPS does not reuse an existing editor for a file,
              but instead opens a new editor. This leads to confusion. This
              seems to happen mostly when creating and saving new files.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1.1 on 2014-11-06

  Workaround: After saving a new file, close the editor and reopen it.

KP-61-NA27-039 GPS: incorrect highlight of changed value in debugger data

  Problem:    When the debugger refreshes the contents of the data window,
              some values are left highlighted in red as if they had just
              been modified, even when they were modified during some previous
              step.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1.1 on 2014-11-05

  Workaround: This only impact the colors, the actual values are correct.

KP-61-N604-003 GPS: scroll bars not displayed in editors

  Problem:    After restarting GPS some windows do not have scrollbars, but
              the text is positioned in a such way that the top part of the
              file is above the top of the editor window. This prevents normal
              navigation it the file.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1.1 on 2014-11-19

  Workaround: Close and reopen the editor.
