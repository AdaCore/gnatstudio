Known problems fixed in GPS 6.1.1
---------------------------------

KP-61-NB05-034 GPS: not reusing existing editor

  Problem:    In some cases, GPS does not reuse an existing editor for a file,
              but instead opens a new editor. This leads to confusion. This
              seems to happen mostly when creating and saving new files.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1.1 on 2014-11-06

  Workaround: After saving a new file, close the editor and reopen it.

KP-61-NA27-039 GPS: incorrect highlight of changed value in debugger data

  Problem:    When the debugger refreshes the contents of the data window,
              some values are left highlighted in red as if they had just
              been modified, even when they were modified during some previous
              step.

  Status:     This was fixed in 6.1.1 on 2014-11-05

  Workaround: This only impact the colors, the actual values are correct.
