New features in GPS 6.1.0 / GNATbench 2.9.0
-------------------------------------------

NF-61-N515-018 gnatinspect recognizes IDE'Xref_Database (2014-05-16)

  This attribute is used to specify the location of the xref database. It was
  so far only recognized by GPS, which set up the appropriate command line
  switches for gnatinspect. This attribute is now also recognize by gnatinspect
  itself, so that it creates the database in the right location.

NF-61-N415-035 GPS: change icon for root project in Project view (2014-05-05)

  The icon for the root project is now different from that of other projects,
  to make it easier to spot the root project.

NF-61-N407-023 GPS: New syntax highlighting engine (2014-05-13)

  GPS has a new extensible syntax highlighting engine, that will be used for C,
  C++ and python by default, and is extensible in python, as documented in GPS
  user's guide.

NF-61-N305-035 GPS: support for aggregate projects (2014-03-10)

  GPS now supports aggregate projects (read-only). Since those allow for
  duplicate file names within the loaded project, GPS will now show the
  context project in appropriate places (notebook tabs, omni-search box),
  and use this project to resolve cross-references.

NF-61-N226-002 Improved indentation of subtype predicates (2014-03-26)

  It is now possible to use Python plug-ins to provide custom entries
  in the completion window for source files.

NF-61-N219-023 GPS: improve gnatname integration (2014-03-22)

  To improve gnatname integration in GPS new project type wizard was
  implemented. The wizard asks only base questions and accepts file
  patterns to create a project from existing Ada files with arbitrary
  names.

NF-61-N213-012 GPS: new plugin treemove (2014-02-14)

  This plugin improves key navigation in trees like the Project Explorer.

  The "ClearCase Native" VCS now supports querying against the working
  revision.

  GPS is now shipped with a new command-line tool for documentation
  generation, called gnatdoc.

  Amongst the features of GNATdoc are:
    - support of Javadoc/Doxygen style of tags in documentation comments
    - support for comment placement detection
    - support for separating documentation comments from code comments
    - a new extensible HTML back-end

NF-61-MC02-033 GPS: Minor enhancements to the tip-of-the-day (2013-12-02)

  The "tip of the day" dialog can now be moved, and the text for the
  documentation can be selected.

NF-61-MC02-016 GPS: Automatic indentation of pasted content (2013-12-17)

  When you paste content in a source editor that supports automatic
  indentation, it will be indented automatically, provided you have switched
  the feature on via the preferences dialog (Editor -> Auto indent on paste)

NF-61-MB26-054 GPS: New line number display preference (2013-11-27)

  The "Display line numbers" preference now settings Never, Some_Lines,
  All_Lines. The new Some_Lines option displays every fifth line number,
  reducing visual clutter and making the source code stand out more.

NF-61-MB18-023 GPS: Periodic recomputation of XRefs while editing (2013-12-18)

  Cross references information is recomputed regularly with the live content of
  the editor every time the content of the buffer is changed. This in turns
  gives better support for navigation, highlighting, and every functionality
  based on cross references.

NF-61-MB13-072 GPS: new block completions available (2013-11-25)

  Block completion now supports protected types and tasks.

NF-61-MB13-030 GPS: Use a fallback by name for cross references (2013-11-14)

  The GPS cross reference engine will now use imprecise information from the
  completion engine to find the origin of an entity, so that it is able to
  resolve an entity by name, even when this entity is not visible in the
  lexical closure of the user's code

NF-61-MA25-032 GPS: Use the primary modifier for shortcuts (2013-10-29)

  GPS now uses the primary system modifier key instead of the fixed control
  key for its default key shortcuts. This has only effects on OSX, where this
  modifier is mapped to the command key.

NF-61-MA22-042 GPS: Recompute Xrefs on file save (2013-10-29)

  GPS now recomputes the cross references of a given file every time this file
  is saved. This enhances the quality of all tools relying on the cross
  references engine - refactorings, code navigation, occurences highlighting,
  etc.

NF-61-MA21-056 GPS: Autofix to current file only (2013-11-05)

  Autofix menu was extended with items to restrict fixing of simple errors and
  warnings to current file occurencies.

NF-61-MA18-041 GPS: Menus described in menus.xml (2013-11-13)

  GPS now describes its menu layout in an external file, which can be used
  to reorder menus or even hide some of them.
  As part of this refactoring, we detected that the icon 'Reload project'
  in the Project view was not working the same as the menu /Project/Reload,
  which has been fixed.

NF-61-MA18-018 GPS: New plug-in vim.py (2013-10-18)

  GPS now has a vim emulation layer, that aims to reproduce the behavior of the
  vim text editor in GPS editor buffers. It will be enabled by default in all
  buffers if you activate it via the plug-ins dialog.

NF-61-MA07-059 GPS: Copy/Paste operations using multi-cursors (2013-11-29)

  When multiple selections are active, it is possible to cut, copy, and paste
  with multiple cursors. If the copy buffer has been filled with the same
  cursors, then the content of each individual cursor will be pasted. If the
  buffer was filled with only the main cursor, or with other cursors in a
  precedent operation, the content of the main buffer will be replicated on
  every cursor's location. Cut and copy works as you would expect.
  Multi-cursors buffers are ignored in the context of other applications, or
  when there are no multi cursors active.

NF-61-MA07-049 GPS: Multi selection using multi-cursors (2013-11-29)

  When multiple cursors are active, it is now possible to select simultaneously
  with all cursors as you would with one.

NF-61-MA04-035 GPS: remove busy cursor (2013-11-22)

  GPS no longer uses a "busy" cursor when it is doing long operations,
  since this is better replaced by the main progress bar. A busy cursor is
  typically hard to aim. The corresponding python API GPS.set_busy,
  GPS.unset_busy and GPS.get_busy have been removed.

NF-61-M722-010 GPS: Bind goto next/previous location to Alt+Arrows (2013-12-12)

  Goto next location is now bound to Alt+Right and Goto previous location is
  now bound to Alt+Left. This is meant to mimic the behaviour of numerous
  modern applications, most notably popular web browsers, have for navigating
  the history.

NF-61-M108-043 GPS: Highlight custom patterns in Messages View (2013-12-02)

   The Message View highlights text according to user defined regular
   expressions and colors.

NF-61-LC05-020 GPS: Open shell from icons in Project View (2013-11-07)

  Shell plugin extends contextual menu to lauch shell from Project View and
  others contexts where directory information available.

NF-61-LB30-034 GPS: Faster Ways to Open and Navigate GPR files (2013-10-21)

  New action "Edit project source file" provides fastest way to open the source
  of current project in GPS editor.

NF-61-LA23-042 GPS: Show "withs" in Outline view (2014-04-08)

  New filter in Outline view enables visualization of with-clauses in current
  compilation unit to find them easier among unsorted clauses and comments.

NF-61-LA18-019 GPS: "file changed on disk" dialog review (2014-05-21)

  The dialog that pops up when a file has been modified on the disk has been
  modified. It will now list all such files in a single dialog (as opposed to
  having one dialog per file when it gets the focus). There is now also an
  option for automatically reloading files (which can be undone).

NF-61-KA19-010 GPS: Integrate GNATcoverage detailed messages (2013-11-13)

  The GNATcoverage plug-in in GPS can now get the detailed coverage messages
  for each line and display them in the location window. These messages can
  also be displayed inside the corresponding editors by clicking on the
  coverage status margin.

NF-61-K330-018 GB: Improved new-project wizard (2014-02-04)

  The GNATbench new-project wizard no longer inserts RTP switches in the new
  project file.  Specifically, "-mrtp" and "--RTS=rtp" are now handled
  automatically by GPRbuild so they are not needed in the project file.

NF-61-H227-033 GPS: Implement auto-refresh mode for memory view (2014-04-02)

  Now memory view is auto-refresh during debug session. Changed pieces of
  data are hightlighted. This feature could be deactivated in preferences
  however.
