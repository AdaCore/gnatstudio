  A builder target having its launch mode set to "On File Change" will be
  automatically launched each time an ada file is saved.
  Wind River Workbench users can use this feature to have ada code analyzed as
  soon as it is saved.
  Builder target settings are accessible through Ada / Builder Targets
  preferences page.

NF-61-N919-015 GPS: alignment preserves the selection (2014-09-19)

  When using the contextual menu Align, this will now preserve the selection
  so that multiple such commands can be chained.

NF-61-N918-040 Support for Runtime & Target attributes in projects (2014-10-17)

  These two new attributes are now supported by GPS and should replace the use
  of the IDE'Gnatlist attribute to specify the same information.

NF-61-N918-036 GPS: outline showing C structs and typedefs (2014-09-19)

  The outline will now show entries for the named C structs (i.e. not those
  defined as part of a typedef). For instance, "struct foo {}" and
  "typedef struct foo bar" will generated entries, but not
  "typedef struct { ... } bar"

NF-61-N916-012 GPS: folding compartments in entity view (2014-09-16)

  Entities browser. A new local configuration is also available to chose
  whether to display fully qualified names or simple names for the boxes.

NF-61-N916-003 GPS: new File Operations menu in project view (2014-09-16)

  The File Operations menu, already available in the Files view, has also been
  added to the Project view. Through this contextual menu, it is possible to
  easily create new files or directories, rename existing files or directories,
  and delete them.

NF-61-N915-032 GPS: save browser contents in desktop (2014-09-16)

  When GPS is restarted, the contents of the various browsers (call graph,
  project dependencies, file dependencies or entities) is restored.

  Indentation of Ada 2012 conditional expressions (if and case expressions)
  spanning multiple lines has been improved.

NF-61-N724-011 GPS: animations in browsers (2014-07-24)

  GPS now uses animations in the browsers (call graph, project,...) when items
  are moved from one position to another. This helps preserve the context.

NF-61-N718-017 GPS: review call graph browser (2014-07-21)

  The call graph browser was redesigned. The rendering has changed. We no
  longer display the list of locations for the references (which is more
  usable in the Call Trees), so as to be able to display more items in the
  browser. Standard contextual menus related to entities are now usable in
  the browser.

NF-61-N718-015 GPS: add filter in Project browser (2014-07-21)

  The project browser now has a local filter, instead of having a specialized
  search context in the standard search dialog.

NF-61-N711-039 GPS: new parameter on_exit to BuildTarget.execute (2014-07-11)

  The command GPS.BuildTarget.execute now accepts an extra parameter on_exit:
  a function which is called when the build target terminates.

NF-61-N703-030 GPS: allow wider omni-search field (2014-07-04)

  A new setting allows users to chose the size of the omni-search field. On
  large screens, it can now display long file names more conveniently.

NF-61-N702-039 GB: add Ada/Environment preferences page (2014-10-08)

  New Ada/Environment preferences page allows the configuration of the
  environment used when GNATbench launch any command.

  Scenario variables changes are taken into account immediately without
  having to restart GNATbench.

NF-61-N624-034 GPS: remove Search in Project view (2014-06-25)

  In the /Navigate/Find or Replace dialog, there is no longer a context to
  search in the project view. Instead, users should use the new filter in
  the Project view. Editors still have a "Locate in Project view" contextual
  menu.

NF-61-N623-035 GPS: show runtime files in Project view (2014-06-25)

  The Project view now has a setting to show the runtime files.

NF-61-N619-029 GPS: on-the-fly syntax error reporting for Python (2014-09-01)

  GPS now runs the pep8 syntax checking library on Python source editors
  and reports errors as you type.

  GPS provides auto-indentation for Python files.

NF-61-N603-059 GPS: support for auto-completion in Python (2014-06-25)

  GPS now provides smart completion in Python files, providing
  completion for modules found in the standard Python search paths
  and all source directories for projects that list "Python" as their
  language.

  This is done through an integration of the Jedi library.

NF-61-N515-018 gnatinspect recognizes IDE'Xref_Database (2014-05-16)

  This attribute is used to specify the location of the xref database. It was
  so far only recognized by GPS, which set up the appropriate command line
  switches for gnatinspect. This attribute is now also recognize by gnatinspect
  itself, so that it creates the database in the right location.

NF-61-N415-035 GPS: change icon for root project in Project view (2014-05-05)

  The icon for the root project is now different from that of other projects,
  to make it easier to spot the root project.

  C++ and python by default, and is extensible in python, as documented in GPS
  user's guide.

NF-61-N305-035 GPS: support for aggregate projects (2014-03-10)

  GPS now supports aggregate projects (read-only). Since those allow for
  duplicate file names within the loaded project, GPS will now show the
  context project in appropriate places (notebook tabs, omni-search box),
  and use this project to resolve cross-references.

NF-61-N226-002 Improved indentation of subtype predicates (2014-03-26)

  The indentation of subtype predicates when continuation lines is now
  better handled.

NF-61-N221-020 GPS: Setting for background color of expanded code (2014-05-16)

  It is now possible to use Python plug-ins to provide custom entries
  in the completion window for source files.

NF-61-N219-023 GPS: improve gnatname integration (2014-03-22)

  To improve gnatname integration in GPS new project type wizard was
  implemented. The wizard asks only base questions and accepts file
  patterns to create a project from existing Ada files with arbitrary
  names.

NF-61-N213-012 GPS: new plugin treemove (2014-02-14)

  This plugin improves key navigation in trees like the Project Explorer.
  Left and Right will now move the cursor up or down, and automatically
  expand or collapse nodes to match the default behavior on Windows.

  Multiple calls to the action "Delete Line" can now be undo-ed one by one.

NF-61-MC17-032 GPS: Improved auto-align end of line comments (2013-12-17)

  Align end of line comments now ignores comments that don't have code before
  them.

NF-61-MC04-022 GB: Preference to not generate pretty print backup (2014-01-21)

  A new preference has been added to the Tools preference page to not
  generate a backup .npp file when pretty printing.

NF-61-MC03-047 GPS: New technology for documentation generation (2014-05-12)

  GPS is now shipped with a new command-line tool for documentation
  generation, called gnatdoc.

  Amongst the features of GNATdoc are:
    - support of Javadoc/Doxygen style of tags in documentation comments
    - support for comment placement detection
    - support for separating documentation comments from code comments
    - a new extensible HTML back-end
      - support for users defined image directory
      - support for package groups

NF-61-MC02-033 GPS: Minor enhancements to the tip-of-the-day (2013-12-02)

  The "tip of the day" dialog can now be moved, and the text for the
  documentation can be selected.

NF-61-MC02-016 GPS: Automatic indentation of pasted content (2013-12-17)

  When you paste content in a source editor that supports automatic
  indentation, it will be indented automatically, provided you have switched
  the feature on via the preferences dialog (Editor -> Auto indent on paste)

NF-61-MB26-054 GPS: New line number display preference (2013-11-27)

  The "Display line numbers" preference now settings Never, Some_Lines,
  All_Lines. The new Some_Lines option displays every fifth line number,

  A new filter was added to the Project view to hide empty directories.

NF-61-MB18-023 GPS: Periodic recomputation of XRefs while editing (2013-12-18)

  Cross references information is recomputed regularly with the live content of
  the editor every time the content of the buffer is changed. This in turns
  gives better support for navigation, highlighting, and every functionality
  based on cross references.

NF-61-MB15-006 GPS: move to previous and next entry in call tree (2014-07-15)

  Two new buttons (and the correspondings actions to which we can associate
  key bindings) were added to the call trees' local toolbar, to move to the
  next and previous location.

NF-61-MB13-072 GPS: new block completions available (2013-11-25)

  Block completion now supports protected types and tasks.

NF-61-MB13-030 GPS: Use a fallback by name for cross references (2013-11-14)

  The GPS cross reference engine will now use imprecise information from the
  completion engine to find the origin of an entity, so that it is able to
  resolve an entity by name, even when this entity is not visible in the
  lexical closure of the user's code

NF-61-MA25-032 GPS: Use the primary modifier for shortcuts (2013-10-29)

  GPS now uses the primary system modifier key instead of the fixed control
  key for its default key shortcuts. This has only effects on OSX, where this
  modifier is mapped to the command key.

NF-61-MA22-042 GPS: Recompute Xrefs on file save (2013-10-29)

  GPS now recomputes the cross references of a given file every time this file
  is saved. This enhances the quality of all tools relying on the cross
  references engine - refactorings, code navigation, occurences highlighting,
  etc.

NF-61-MA21-056 GPS: Autofix to current file only (2013-11-05)

  Autofix menu was extended with items to restrict fixing of simple errors and
  warnings to current file occurencies.

NF-61-MA18-041 GPS: Menus described in menus.xml (2013-11-13)

  GPS now describes its menu layout in an external file, which can be used
  to reorder menus or even hide some of them.
  As part of this refactoring, we detected that the icon 'Reload project'
  in the Project view was not working the same as the menu /Project/Reload,
  which has been fixed.

NF-61-MA18-018 GPS: New plug-in vim.py (2013-10-18)

  GPS now has a vim emulation layer, that aims to reproduce the behavior of the
  vim text editor in GPS editor buffers. It will be enabled by default in all
  buffers if you activate it via the plug-ins dialog.

NF-61-MA10-046 GPS: defining tool switches no longer needs size (2014-08-14)

  When you define new tool switches with <tool><switches...></tool>, you no
  longer need to define the "lines" and "columns" attributes, which are
  computed automatically.

NF-61-MA07-059 GPS: Copy/Paste operations using multi-cursors (2013-11-29)

  When multiple selections are active, it is possible to cut, copy, and paste
  with multiple cursors. If the copy buffer has been filled with the same
  cursors, then the content of each individual cursor will be pasted. If the
  buffer was filled with only the main cursor, or with other cursors in a
  precedent operation, the content of the main buffer will be replicated on
  every cursor's location. Cut and copy works as you would expect.
  Multi-cursors buffers are ignored in the context of other applications, or
  when there are no multi cursors active.

NF-61-MA07-049 GPS: Multi selection using multi-cursors (2013-11-29)

  When multiple cursors are active, it is now possible to select simultaneously
  with all cursors as you would with one.

NF-61-MA04-035 GPS: remove busy cursor (2013-11-22)

  GPS no longer uses a "busy" cursor when it is doing long operations,
  since this is better replaced by the main progress bar. A busy cursor is
  typically hard to aim. The corresponding python API GPS.set_busy,
  GPS.unset_busy and GPS.get_busy have been removed.

NF-61-M917-006 GPS: Review key shortcuts dialog (2014-05-23)

  This dialog can now be embedded in the main GPS window, and kept open.
  Changes are automatically changed (the save button was removed). A filter
  has been added to make it easy to find the proper action or shortcut.
  User-defined shortcuts are displayed in bold. The icons associated with
  actions are displayed, for consistency with the rest of GPS. Menus are no
  longer displayed in the dialog, since it is better to associate the
  shortcuts with the corresponding action instead. Multiple key themes are
  provided and can dynamically be switched (the emacs.py plug-in was removed
  and replaced with an Emacs key theme instead)

NF-61-M802-014 GB: SPARK2014 Traces support (2014-07-02)

  Selecting a SPARK2014 Problem marker having an associated trace, highlight
  the source lines containing a trace. Selecting again the same marker hides
  the highlighted lines.

NF-61-M724-024 GPS: save scenario on exit and restore on startup (2014-09-18)

  The value for the scenario variables is saved when GPS exits or you load a
  new project, and restored when the same project is loaded in the future
  (unless a new value is specified via environment variables or the -X
  command line parameter).

NF-61-M722-010 GPS: Bind goto next/previous location to Alt+Arrows (2013-12-12)

  Goto next location is now bound to Alt+Right and Goto previous location is
  now bound to Alt+Left. This is meant to mimic the behaviour of numerous
  modern applications, most notably popular web browsers, have for navigating
  the history.

NF-61-M612-030 GPS, GB: Rean-only message review dialog (2014-08-12)

  Message review dialog doesn't allow to change message review status when
  message was reviewed in source code with pragma Annotate.

NF-61-M506-012 GPS: smarter browser layout (2014-07-16)

  As part of revisiting the display in the browsers, the layout algorithm has
  also been improved and should result in fewer overlap of items and links.

NF-61-M207-022 GPS: CodePeer messages grouping in Locations view (2014-07-31)

  All CodePeer messages (SCIL compilation errors, warnings and checks, race
  conditions) are displayed in one category in Locations view.

NF-61-M108-043 GPS: Highlight custom patterns in Messages View (2013-12-02)

   The Message View highlights text according to user defined regular
   expressions and colors.

NF-61-LC05-020 GPS: Open shell from icons in Project View (2013-11-07)

  Shell plugin extends contextual menu to lauch shell from Project View and
  others contexts where directory information available.

NF-61-LB30-034 GPS: Faster Ways to Open and Navigate GPR files (2013-10-21)

  New action "Edit project source file" provides fastest way to open the source
  of current project in GPS editor.

NF-61-LB28-047 GPS: not grouping by directories in Project view (2014-06-25)

  A new setting in the Project view was added to show files directly underneath
  projects, and not grouped by directories.

NF-61-LA23-042 GPS: Show "withs" in Outline view (2014-04-08)

  New filter in Outline view enables visualization of with-clauses in current
  compilation unit to find them easier among unsorted clauses and comments.

NF-61-LA18-022 GPS: Review handling of auto-saved files (2014-09-17)

  When you open a file for which there exists an auto-save file, GPS displays
  a dialog asking whether you would like to load this auto-save file instead
  of the actual file. This dialog was enhanced with the following
  capabilities: not displayed when the auto-save file contains the same thing
  as the file itself; loading the auto-save file can be undone, thus ending
  with the actual file, or redone, thus going back to the auto-save file.

NF-61-LA18-019 GPS: "file changed on disk" dialog review (2014-05-21)

  The dialog that pops up when a file has been modified on the disk has been
  modified. It will now list all such files in a single dialog (as opposed to
  having one dialog per file when it gets the focus). There is now also an
  option for automatically reloading files (which can be undone).

NF-61-L810-013 GPS: Clear locations view for an individual file (2014-05-29)

  New contextual menu added to clear Location View from messages for current
  file only. Corresponding action allows binding key shortcut.

NF-61-L621-013 GPS: remove the GPS Shell console (2014-09-16)

  Although the GPS shell scripting is still supported for this language, the
  console itself has been removed. We recommend using the Python console
  instead. Most commands are available there, with the following replacements
  possible:
            GPS Shell         |    Python
                cd            | os.chdir('...')
                pwd           | os.getcwd()
                ls            | os.listdir('...')
                help          | help(...)

NF-61-KB22-012 GPS: auto-load plugin (2014-08-15)

  GPS now loads project-specific plugin named <project>.ide.py when
  root <project>.gpr is open.

NF-61-KA19-010 GPS: Integrate GNATcoverage detailed messages (2013-11-13)

  The GNATcoverage plug-in in GPS can now get the detailed coverage messages
  for each line and display them in the location window. These messages can
  also be displayed inside the corresponding editors by clicking on the
  coverage status margin.

NF-61-K330-018 GB: Improved new-project wizard (2014-02-04)

  The GNATbench new-project wizard no longer inserts RTP switches in the new
  project file.  Specifically, "-mrtp" and "--RTS=rtp" are now handled
  automatically by GPRbuild so they are not needed in the project file.

NF-61-JB10-042 GPS: filter in project view (2014-06-24)

  The Project view now includes a filter in its local toolbar. A number of
  additional settings were also added to its local config menu: hiding
  object directories and sorting imported projects before directories.

NF-61-J601-013 GPS: Save callgraph browsers across sessions (2014-08-13)

  The contents of the callgraph browser is now saved when GPS exits, and
  restored the next time it is restarted.

NF-61-H227-033 GPS: Implement auto-refresh mode for memory view (2014-04-02)

  The memory view is now refreshed automatically during debugging sessions.
  Changed pieces of data are hightlighted. This feature can also deactivated
  via a preference.
