--  This package implements the Boyer-Moore algorithm for string searching,
--  as described in the book "Algorithms" by T. Cormen (McGrawHill edts)
--
--  A pattern must first be compiled before being searched.
--
--  Some comparisons between the string-searching algorithms provided in the
--  GNAT technology:
--    (1)  Trivial inlined loop (test string equality for each position)
--    (2)  Ada.Strings.Fixed.Index
--    (3)  GNAT.Regpat.Match
--    (4)  Boyer_Moore.Search
--  These algorithms have been tests on a series of strings. They
--  always matched on the last line of the string.
--  The compilations were done with "-O2 -gnatN -gnatnp"
--  The time was mesured with Ada.Calendar.

--  The trivial loop is something similar to:
--      for Index in Source'Range loop
--          if Source (Index .. Index + Pattern'Length - 1) = Pattern then
--              return Index;
--          end if;
--      end loop;
--
--  Complexity
--  ==========
--   n = length of the source string in which we search
--   m = length of the pattern to match
--   sigma = length of the alphabet (ie number of different letters in the
--       pattern).
--   The worst-case running time is O((n - m + 1)m + sigma).
--   However, in pratice this is often the best algorithm.

package Boyer_Moore is

   type Pattern is private;

   Max_Pattern_Length : constant := Integer'Last;
   --  Maximal length for patterns that can be searched.
   --  Changing this means that patterns will simply use more space.

   procedure Compile
     (Motif          : in out Pattern;
      From_String    : String;
      Case_Sensitive : Boolean := True);
   --  Compile the required tables to match From_String anywhere.
   --  Motif needs to be freed when you are done using it.
   --
   --  Note: A case_sensitive search is always more efficient, and should
   --  be used if you don't specifically need a case insensitive search.

   procedure Free (Motif : in out Pattern);
   --  Free the memory occupied by the motif.

   function Search (Motif : Pattern; In_String : String) return Integer;
   --  Return the location of the match for Motif in In_String, or -1 if there
   --  is no match;

private
   subtype Offset is Natural range 0 .. Max_Pattern_Length;
   --  This is the maximal offset reported by pattern. This might result in
   --  a slightly less efficient processing for patterns longer than this in
   --  extreme cases, but these are for very rare cases.

   type Occurrence_Array is array (Character) of Offset;
   type Offset_Array is array (Natural range <>) of Offset;
   type Offset_Array_Access is access Offset_Array;
   type String_Access is access String;

   type Pattern is record
      Last_Occurrence : Occurrence_Array;
      Good_Suffix     : Offset_Array_Access;
      Motif           : String_Access;
      Case_Sensitive  : Boolean;
   end record;
