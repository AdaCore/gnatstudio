-- Improvements --
------------------

  * [Yeti] Obtaining the project file list

  * [Yeti] Scan empty lines ?
    Only useful when pattern matches empty string.

  * [Yeti] Move the abort flag and the callback access in Hyper_Grep_Record.

  * [Yeti] Desactivate Stop when not searching, Start when searching.

  * [Yeti] Don't discard syntactic delimiters " /* -- */ in matching ?

  * [Yeti] Avoid // in pathnames.

  * [Yeti] in C strings, '\' skips ASCII.LF; don't skip LF without '\' ?

  * [Yeti] handle "" in Ada strings as a '"' character, not as the string end
    and the start of another string.

  * [Yeti] Add a callback reporting failures (opening error, ...)

  * [Yeti] Add a Match_Array parameter to the callback

  * [Yeti] When no initial directory, use no explicit one.

  * [Yeti] Whole_Word option unuseful when Regexp ???

  * [Yeti] Merge Scan_File_With_Context and Scan_Line_With_Context
    Avoids calls to SLWC and re-elaboration of declared items, but add
    indentation levels.

  * [Yeti] Caching Language_Context

  * [Yeti] Use Boyer-Moore algorithm instead of Index

  * [Yeti] When Whole_Word without Regexp, search for literal text and then
    verify it's a whole one

-- Bugs --
----------

  * [Yeti] Storage_Error with Browse and Directory_Entry
    Found a scenario: when Hypergrep is just started, unselect the checkbox
    "Scan Only Project Files"; click Browse button; select any dir with mouse
    but don't type a directory; click OK; change the directory entry by typing
    something anywhere or overwriting the selection or deleting/retyping;
    click Start.
    SE is raised by the compilation of the empty Files pattern: the good
    behavior is to compile fine and raise Find_Utils.Search_Error by
    Init_Search.
    Note that the good behavior sometimes happens with this scenario.

  * [Yeti] GNAT.Regexp.Match is said to raise CE when the pattern isn't
    initialized.
