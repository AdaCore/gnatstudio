  * [Yeti] Move the abort flag and the callback access in Hyper_Grep_Record.

    and the start of another string.

-- Bugs --
----------

  * [Yeti] Storage_Error with Browse and Directory_Entry
    Found a scenario: when Hypergrep is just started, unselect the checkbox
    "Scan Only Project Files"; click Browse button; select any dir with mouse
    but don't type a directory; click OK; change the directory entry by typing
    something anywhere or overwriting the selection or deleting/retyping;
    click Start.
    SE is raised by the compilation of the empty Files pattern: the good
    behavior is to compile fine and raise Find_Utils.Search_Error by
    Init_Search.
    Note that the good behavior sometimes happens with this scenario.

  * [Yeti] GNAT.Regexp.Match is said to raise CE when the pattern isn't
    initialized.
