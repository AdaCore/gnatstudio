  * [Yeti] Browse initial directory
    Should be "." if Directory_Entry is empty, its content otherwise.

  * [Yeti] Dialog box when Pattern_Entry is empty. Also for Files_Pattern, when
    not searching in project files.

  * [Yeti] Set case sensitivity of Files_Combo and Directory_Combo accordingly
    with the underlying OS

  * [Yeti] Add predefined files extensions
    e.g.: *.ad[sb], *.[ch], *.java, ...

  * [Yeti] Add predefined patterns
    e.g.: "when \w+( : \w+) =>", "pragma \w+;", ...
    See ../regexps.txt.

  * [Yeti] Stop searching when closing the hypergrep window.

  * [Yeti] Set case sensitivity of Pattern_Combo accordingly with Case_Check ?

  * [Yeti] Replace scope check boxes by a combo with Set_Value_In_List.

-- Improvements --
------------------

  * [Yeti] Obtaining the project file list

  * [Yeti] Move the abort flag and the callback access in Hyper_Grep_Record.

  * [Yeti] Don't discard syntactic delimiters " /* -- */ in matching ?

  * [Yeti] in C strings, '\' skips ASCII.LF; don't skip LF without '\' ?

  * [Yeti] handle "" in Ada strings as a '"' character, not as the string end
    and the start of another string.

  * [Yeti] Add a callback reporting failures (opening error, ...)

  * [Yeti] A callback for matches and another for files

  * [Yeti] Select between reporting all matches in the line or only the first.

  * [Yeti] Avoid endless recursion
    Links such as "up_dir -> ..", "here -> ."

  * [Yeti] Get match position with Boyer-Moore too

  * [Yeti] Specify the full view limited.

  * [Yeti] Document the lifecycle: Init [Do] Free {Free}.
    Maximum 1 Do_Search, at least 1 Free, more does nothing.

  * [Yeti] Handle Free called by the callback
    Only say it is a bad idea, or better protect against it ?

7 * [Yeti] Merge Scan_File_With_Context and Scan_Line_With_Context
    Avoids calls to SLWC and re-elaboration of declared items, but add
    indentation levels.
    Other possibility, scan whole file and periodically call Handle_ASCII_LF.

8 * [Yeti] Caching Language_Context

  * [Yeti] Use Boyer-Moore algorithm on whole file instead of every line
    Get the line number (and lexical state, if needed) after a match is found,
    instead of splitting the file in lines and using BM on every line.

-- Bugs --
----------

  * [Yeti] Storage_Error with Browse and Directory_Entry
    Found a scenario: when Hypergrep is just started, unselect the checkbox
    "Scan Only Project Files"; click Browse button; select any dir with mouse
    but don't type a directory; click OK; change the directory entry by typing
    something anywhere or overwriting the selection or deleting/retyping;
    click Start.
    SE is raised by the compilation of the empty Files pattern: the good
    behavior is to compile fine and raise Find_Utils.Search_Error by
    Init_Search.
    Note that the good behavior sometimes happens with this scenario.

  * [Yeti] GNAT.Regexp.Match is said to raise CE when the pattern isn't
    initialized.
