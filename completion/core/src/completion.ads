--  Provides the base structures / subprograms for the completion manager. A
--  completion manager is the base class of the completion mechanism. Before
--  using it, you have to add manually the completion resolvers you want to

--  it might depend on different datas. You can see for example the subprogram
--  Full_Test in the test driver Completion.Test.
