--  This package implements a completion window, which allows the user to
--  browse through a list of possible completions.
--
--  This is a light window, in the same GUI category as a tooltip window, in
--  that it is ephemeral, without any decoration.
--
--  The main completion contains a tree which displays a list of possible
--  completions. Each line in this list can be associated with an additional
--  text, which will be displayed in a secondary window when the line is
--  selected.
