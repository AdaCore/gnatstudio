   --  The following subprograms can be used to store an entity in a GValue,
   --  for instance to store it in a tree view

   function To_GValue (Entity : Entity_Information) return Glib.Values.GValue;
   function From_GValue (Value : Glib.Values.GValue) return Entity_Information;
   --  Store an entity in a GValue, or get its value back. This properly
   --  handles reference counting, so that while the GValue is in use, the
   --  entity remains valid. The returned entity has a borrow reference, and
   --  thus needs to be Ref'ed if you want to keep it. Removing the row in the
   --  tree for instance makes the entity invalid.

   function Get_Entity_Information_Type return Glib.GType;
   --  Return the type associated with an entity. This is the type that should
   --  be used when creating the tree model.
