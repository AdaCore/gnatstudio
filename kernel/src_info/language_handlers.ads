--  This package provides the registry for all supported languages in GPS.
--
--  When adding new languages, the following needs to be done:
--    - Register the new language with Register_Language. This is associated
--      with basic syntactic information for highlighting in the source editor
--      and manipulation through the debugger. It is also associated with the
--      LI handler that is responsible for generating the xref information for
--      that language
--
--  The naming scheme for a language is defined through either the project
--  itself, or through a default naming scheme registered for custom languages
--  in Projects.Registry.Register_Default_Language_Extension.
