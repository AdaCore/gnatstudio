#None of the Apollo compilers can compile gas or binutils.  The preprocessor
# chokes on bfd, the compiler won't let you assign integers to enums, and
# other problems.  Defining CC to gcc is a questionable way to say "don't use
# the apollo compiler" (the preferred version of GCC could be called cc,
# or whatever), but I'm not sure leaving CC as cc is any better...
