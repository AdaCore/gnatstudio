2001-02-14  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* gui/version.tcl (sn_rcs_diff): Block
	the UI via tixBusy while waiting for
	a revision log command to complete.

	the transient method to work around a
	bug that causes a transient window to
	be re-mapped under Windows.

	* parsers/m4/m4browser.l: Define
	global xrefs as if they were
	in a function named GLOBAL.
	Eat \$ pattern so that \$foo

	When destroying the tmp scale
	window widget, call update

	* gui/greppane.tcl (text_b1_down,
	text_b1_up, text_b1_double): Set
	mouse motion binding after a
	normal click action, this
	will make canceling a mouse
	event safe with respect to mouse
	motion events.

2001-02-09  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* gui/greppane.tcl (ExecGrep, finish_grep):
	Remove calls to tixBusy, we can't blocks

	handle_return, text_b1_double, Focus):

	click but not on a double click.

2001-02-08  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* gui/greppane.tcl: Revert changes
	from 2001-02-06 that dealt with

	button while make is running.

2001-02-08  Ian Roxborough  <irox@redhat.com>

	* gui/misc.tcl (sn_show_splash_screen):

	* tests/gui/combo.test: Remove or update
 	test for the -state active option, we
	only support normal and disabled. Add
	new tests to fully exercise the -state

	descriptive comments to
	option declarations.

2001-01-31  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* gui/combo.tcl (menu_selection):
	Make the menu_selection method private.

	* gui/combo.tcl (menu_first, get,
	select, see, insert): Remove unused
	methods and variables.

	the index being selected.
	* gui/makepane.tcl (constructor):
	* gui/rcs.tcl(constructor):  Use
	the Combo& selecttext method instead

	list and selecttext does not. Also,
	the select method is being phased out.

2001-01-30  Ian Roxborough  <irox@redhat.com>

	* parsers/cpp/cpplib/sp_process.c (Put_cross_ref):
	Make Put_cross_ref call correct put_cross_ref call

	* gui/retriever.tcl (read_matched_from_db):
	Fix "empty list getting lindexed" problem
	that caused above errors in the editor.

2001-01-30  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* gui/greppane.tcl (finish_grep): Add
	a text widget see call so that you
	can actually see a TRUNCATED message
	appended to the end of the results.
	Don't query the full contents of
	the result text widget just to find
	out if any results were added. Instead
	we just query the end index to see
	if any result lines were added.

2001-01-30  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* gui/combo.tcl (menu_place): Remove
	unused combowidth and comboheight

	* gui/greppane.tcl: Changed lots of things

	Reenable): Move code common to pane
	activate methods into MultiWindow&
	Activate. Don't use Combo& selecttext
	when a configure -entrytext will do.
	Keep the symbol combo in the normal
	state except when switching to the
	Retriever or Grep tabs. When
	splitting a Retriever or Grep tab,
	re-enable the symbol combo. Fix up
	broken variables in xref fill
	method. Don't disable the xref
	symbol combo otherwise one could
	not type into the entry. Make
	the xref Reenable method a no-op,
	since the symbol combo is not
	disabled to begin with.

2001-01-26  Ian Roxborough  <irox@redhat.com>

	* gui/greppane.tcl (Grep): the grep window
	will now block and display the hour glass
	when it can't take user input.

	* gui/greppane.tcl (Grep::print): Don't
	use old static method calling syntax.

	* gui/error.tcl:
	* gui/selector.tcl:

2000-12-11  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* gui/classpane.tcl: Use -entryvariable
	instead of -textvariable.
	* gui/combo.tcl (clearentry, getentry,
	-textvariable): Don't pass the -textvariable
	option to the entry widget. Use OptionTrace
	to maintain -entryvariable and -entrytext,
	instead of using -textvariable. Use the
	-entrytext property instead of directly
	accessing the entry widget.
	* gui/editorpane.tcl:

	* gui/tools.tcl: Modify LabelEntryButton&
	class to use the OptionTrace commands.
	* tests/gui/labelentrybutton.test: Remove

	* gui/targetedit.tcl (CreateDialog): Set the
	LEB -command option after the LEB has been
	added to the target editor dialog. This fixes
	a problem in the target editor where the

	the call to centerOnScreen into Dialog class.

2000-11-13  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* gui/dialog.tcl: Hide on_close command from
	Window class, classes that inherit from Dialog
	must never call this method. Don't allow the
	-modality option to get changed while the
	Dialog is active. Add _active state variable,
	it will be set to true while the dialog is shown.
	Raise error if hull is already mapped when
	activate is called. Raise error if Dialog is
	activated twice. Raise error if deactivate
	is called when not active. If the destructor
	is called while still active, call deactivate
	before cleaning up. Don't use the after
	command to go to sleep, use vwait instead.
	* gui/dirdialog.tcl (cancel, getSelectedDir):
	Rename DirDialog& to sourcenav::DirDialog.
	Remove cancel and getSelectedDir methods.
	Don't implicitly delete the Dialog object,

	to make sure it is getting cleaned up properly.
	Check for invalid operation errors, like calling
	activate twice on the same Dialog. Check that
	<Escape> event will deactivate the Dialog. Make
	sure a hidden window does not turn deactivate
	into a no-op. Add additional checks for event
	delivery to a Dialog that has the grab. Verify
	modality of a Dialog using a second Dialog.
	* tests/gui/dirdialog.test: Update widget
	name to use sourcenav::DirDialog. Call activate
	method instead of getSelectedDir. Check that
	widgets in a Dialog can be accessed with
	generated events. Explicitly delete the
	DirDialog object when finished with it.
	Add timeouts for tests that suffer from
	known WM problems.

2000-11-10  Ian Roxborough  <irox@redhat.com>

	visible. Check each of the known -modality
	options.

	* gui/dirdialog.tcl (select, cancel, display,
	build_filepath, expand): Changed protection of

	for the UNIX and Win32 versions of `Pty_SpawnCmd'.  Eliminate some
	other dead code in this function.

	* hyper/win/pty.c: New file; this is the old hyper/nttty.c.

1998-06-03  Ben Elliston  <bje@cygnus.com>

	* parsers/chill/emit.h (emit_xref_assignment): Adjust function
	prototype to deal with identifierlists instead of a string.

	* parsers/chill/emit.c (emit_xref_assignment): Likewise.  Walk
	through a list of identifiers, emitting a cross-reference to each

	cross-referencing purposes.
	(variable): Correctly tag all kinds of variables.  For example, a

	-Fixed the problem with the realpath so that when SN is trying
         to build the absolute path, the link information isn't losed.
        -Added a tcl/function "sn_absolutepath ?-pwd pwd?" that
         returns the absolute path to a relative path name without
         losing it's symbolic link information.
         A major key that you could specify a base directory to this
         function that is takes ansted the current work directory to
         build the absolute key. Using 'getcwd' returns always the 
         real path.

	*devo/sn/tcl/odd/progs projedit.tcl
	-VERY IMPORTANT, that by adding new files only the new files will be
	 scanned to add them into the project.
	 Before it was so that SN has scanned all the project files, even when
	 the user adds one file (over SAMBA is killing).
	-Bug fix in the project directory initialisation by new projects.
