This is a parser for python source code.

Current limitations:

* Continuation lines (ending in a backslash) are not always
  handled correctly.

* This parser has nearly the same limitations as python's
  class browser module pyclbr.py (which also served as implementation
  guideline). Triple quoted strings are, however, handled correctly.
