This is a parser for sendmail.cf.  It should be generic enough to handle old,
old versions of the configuration file format, right up to V8 and IDA
sendmail.

Current limitations:

* Continuation lines (starting with tab [\t]) are not handled.  I have
  never seen these used anyway.

* It would be cool if macro names were interpreted (ie. DZ showed up in 
  the symbol browser as "version").
