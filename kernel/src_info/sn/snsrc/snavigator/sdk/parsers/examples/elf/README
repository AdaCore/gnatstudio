This directory contains the necessary files to produce a third-party parser
for Source-Navigator.

The ebrowser.l file is a Source-Navigator parser written in GNU flex for the
ELF programming language.  There are two example ELF source files:

	sql.elf
	blobsql.elf

To try out the parser, replace "SN=/usr/local/snavigator" in the Makefile
with the path to your Source-Navigator installation.

Because different operating systems have different library names for the
dynamic loading library, you may need to change the "-ldl" library name
to the library which supports dynamic loading on your system. This is required
to get rid of libtcl8.1 linker errors.

Build and test the parser by running "make test".  The Source-Navigator
project database will be created in the .snprj subdirectory.  During the test,
the names of the known functions in the project will be displayed.

Refer to the Source-Navigator Programmer's Reference Guide for details on
writing additional parsers for other programming languages.
