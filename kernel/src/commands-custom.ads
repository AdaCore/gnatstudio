--  This package implements commands that can be used to launch
--  shell commands that depend on the current context.
--
--  When calling Execute on the command, the arguments will be transformed
--  in the following way
--
--      %f  -> base name of the currently opened file.
--      %F  -> absolute name of the currently opened file.
--
--      %d  -> current directory.    %d%f = %F
--
--      %p  -> the current project (associated with the opened file)
--      %P  -> the current root project
--
--      %{p|P}[r]{d|s}[f] ->
--         Substituted by the contents of a project :
--               P : the project is the root project
--               p : the project is the current project
--               r : indicates that the listing should be project-recursive,
--                   ie that sub-projects should be listed as well, and their
--                   subprojects, and so on.
--               d : list the source directories
--               s : list the source files
--               f : output the list into a file and substitute the
--                   parameter with the name of that file.
--
--          Examples :
--            %Ps   ->  replaced by a list of source files in the root project,
--                      not recursively
--            %prs  ->  replaced by a list of files in the current project,
--                      recursively
--            %prdf ->  replaced by the name of a file that contains a list
--                      of source directories in the current project,
--                      recursively
--
--
--     ??? The following still have to be implemented :
--
--      %l, %c -> the current line and column in the current file.
