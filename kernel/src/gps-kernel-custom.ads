--  This package provides an interface to the customization files.
--  This files are written in XML, and can be found in several places:
--     - system wide directory
--     - project specific directory (not implemented yet)
--     - user specific directory
--  None of these files is specific to any module. They can mix menu additions,
--  new aliases, new languages,... freely, so that the user can organize the
--  files as he sees fit. This also makes it more convenient to add support for
--  new modules that need to extend several other modules.
--
--  All these files are parsed at startup time by GPS, which create an internal
--  repository which can be queries by each module on demand.
--
--  Modules which are interested in customization must provide a callback
--  in their call to Register_Module. This callback will be called at startup
--  once all the modules have been registered. For dynamically loaded modules,
--  this callback is called just after they have been registered.
--  If a module adds a hard coded customization string, all modules will be
--  signaled.
--
--  See GPS.Kernel.Modules.Module_Customization_Handler.

--  Future plans:
--    - Handling of dynamic modules: they need to be aware, when loaded, of
--      the current customizations concerning them. This means either keep in
--      memory the contents of the custom files, or reparse them every time a
--      module is loaded. Likewise for strings executed through
--      Add_Customization_String.
--    - Dynamic modules need to be loaded when the menus they have registered
--      are called initially.
