--  Actions are named commands (or list of commands) in GPS. These can
--  be associated with menus, keys and toolbar buttons among other things.

   --  Filter indicates when the action can be executed. If null, this means
   --  the action can always be executed. The filter mustn't be deallocated
   --  in the life of GPS, since there might be actions bound to it at any
   --  time.
   --  Category is used in the key bindings editor to group actions. If null,
   --  the action should not be shown in the keybinding editor.
   --  Defined_In indicates in which file the action was defined. This is
   --  optional and could be No_File to indicate builtin actions.
