--  This package provides a task manager with a scheduler
--  to handle asynchronous or background tasks run by GPS.
--
--  The task manager is created upon GPS startup.
--
--  By default, the task manager does nothing.
--  When it is given a command (through a call to Add_Command), it will begin
--  the processing of the commands, and will run in the background until all
--  the commands are finished.
