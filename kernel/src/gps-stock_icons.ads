--  This package provides the settings to interact with the gtk+ icon theme.
--
--  By default, gtk+ loads the Adwaita icon theme, which is found in the
--  directory prefix/share/icons/.
--  An extra theme, hicolor, is also defined, and acts as a fallback when
--  icons are not found in Adwaita. GPS adds extra directories to that
--  hicolor theme (gpsprefix/share/icons/hicolor/*), which contain GPS
--  specific icons. As a result, icons from the user's theme (Adwaita) have
--  priority, and GPS icons are loaded as fallbacks.
--
--  In GPS, the following conventions are used:
--    * All icons should be scalable SVG icons. Currently, a few of these
--      SVG simply embed PNG data, but they should be replaced in the long
--      term, so that the icons display properly on hidpi screens.
--
--    * By convention in gtk+, the basename of the file is the name by
--      which the icon is refered to in the code. gtk+ automatically looks
--      for variants, for instance   basename-rtl.svg when using right-to-left
--      writing conventions.
--
--    * in GPS, icon files most often end with "-symbolic.svg". This is a
--      special convention in gtk+. Such icons are displayed as grayscale
--      only, and automatically adapt to dark themes. This means we do not
--      need to provide multiple versions of the images, depending on the
--      user's theme choice.
--      (For this work, icons must use the fill property, not stroke, since
--      only the former is properly converted)
--      In some cases, however, we want to use colors in the icons. In this
--      case, the icon should not use the -symbolic.svg prefix (although this
--      isn't systematic, since colors are sometimes properly displayed for
--      symbolic icons).
--
--    * Icons must be organized into subdirectories based on their default
--      size. gtk+ 3.14.5 will otherwise display warnings. The size of icons
--      in a directory is given in the index.theme file.
--
--    * We use strings to represent the icons in the GPS code, not string
--      constants. This makes it slightly easier to maintain, and it is
--      assumed that someone adding a new icon will properly test that it
--      displays properly, thus limiting the risk of typos.
--
--    * As much as possible, we keep this icon name until the last moment
--      before rendering. This is cleaner than manipulating and storing
--      Gdk_Pixbuf. For instance, icons will automatically adapt to changes
--      in the icon theme, or to screen resolution.
--
--  Some icons can be found in
--      http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Desktop_icons
