   --  This should mostly be used from String_Utils.Substitute.
   --  The empty string "" is returned if Param is not one of the macro
   --  parameters, and Done.all set to False.
   --  If Param is recognized and handled, Done.all is set to True.
   --  It is assumed that Context contains enough information for this
   --  substitution, and this can be checked with Macro_Filter above.
   --  Substrings that start with '%' but are not one of the macros are left
   --  as is.
   --  If Server is not GPS_Server, then all paths will be translated into the
   --  server's file system.
   --  Invalid_Substitution might be raised if the context is still invalid,
   --  although this isn't guaranteed in general and you must check with
   --  Macro_Filter first.
