   --  This should mostly be used from GNATCOLL.Templates.Substitute.
   --  If Param is not one of the macro parameters, set Done.all to False and
   --  return an empty string.
   --  If Param is recognized and handled, Done.all is set to True. Note that
   --  an empty string can be a valid substitution result if Done.all is set
   --  to True.
   --  It is assumed that Context contains enough information for this
   --  substitution, and this can be checked with Macro_Filter above.
   --  Substrings that start with '%' but are not one of the macros are left
   --  as is.
   --  If Server is not GPS_Server, then all paths will be translated into the
   --  server's file system.
   --  Invalid_Substitution might be raised if the context is still invalid,
   --  although this isn't guaranteed in general and you must check with
   --  Macro_Filter first.
   --  For_Shell must be set to True when the result string is to be used by a
   --  shell command. In this case it is needed to escape backslashes.
