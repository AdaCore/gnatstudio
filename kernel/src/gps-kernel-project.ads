--  This package provides access to the project characteristics such as
--  object and source path, options.
--
--  Several concepts are attached to projects, and this interface tries to
--  stay consistent with the following naming:
--
--  A --project-- is a tree representation of a project and its imported
--  projects.
--
--  A --scenario variable-- is any variable in a project that is typed (ie has
--  a defined set of possible values) and references external variables. In the
--  context of the GUI, we do not actually reference environment variables, but
--  these are set to the appropriate values before calling project-aware tools
--  like gnatmake, gnatbind,...
--
--  A --scenario-- is a named set of values for all the environment variables
--  in a project.
--
--  A --project view-- is the result of processing the tree in a given
--  scenario. Such a view needs to be re-eavaluted every time the scenario
--  changes. This is what is actually displayed in the project explorer and the
--  project viewer.
--  A fundamental assumption in the implementation is that the project
--  hierarchy (imported projects, modified projects,...) can not change when
--  the view changes.
