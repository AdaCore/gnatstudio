--  This package provides a Gtk_Tree_View which can remember expanded/collapsed
--  state of the nodes between collapsed/expanded operation on the parent node;
--  filtering out/in and resorting.
--
--  Application must define derived type to provide implementation of two
--  abstract subprograms to convert iterator from view's source model to
--  Lowest model and backward.
--
--  To properly initialize view, call to Initialize must be done first and
--  reference to Lowest model passed to it; after when stack of intermediate
--  models can be created and view's source model must be set by calling
--  Set_Source_Model. Stack of source models can't be changed during view's
--  life. Rationale: callbacks to Lowest model must be set before it is
--  connected to intermediate model; but standard intermediate models allows
--  to set its source model only at creation time.
