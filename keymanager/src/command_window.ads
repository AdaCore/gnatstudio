--  This package provides a command window widget.
--  This window is opened on request of one of the GPS module. There can be
--  only one such window activate at any one time. All key events are
--  redirected to this window.
--  The window is automatically closed when the user presses Enter or a
--  non-graphical key like the movement keys are any key with a modifier.
--
--  This is similar to the Emacs mini-buffer.
