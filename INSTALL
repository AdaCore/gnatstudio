Building/Installing from sources
================================

To build GPS from sources, you need to have GNU make available as
a prerequisite.

You need to use a recent version of the GNAT compiler (e.g. GNAT 5.04a
or GNAT GPL 2005).

You then need to install the Gtk+ 2.x suite (e.g 2.4.14).
To download and build Gtk+, follow the instructions given at www.gtk.org

Once Gtk+ has been installed, you need to install the latest GtkAda 2.4.x
See GtkAda-2.4.x/INSTALL for instructions.

Then make sure that your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables point
to the GtkAda installation

Then you need to install the latest version of XML/Ada, and set the
ADA_PROJECT_PATH environment variable to point to <xml-install>/lib/gnat

Once XML/Ada has been installed, extract the GPS sources:

  $ gzip -dc gps-*-src.tgz | tar xvf -
  $ cd gps*

Then execute the following commands:

  $ ./configure --prefix=<prefix>
  $ make
  $ make install

Note: if you want to use a C compiler other than the one provided with
gnat, you can replace the configure line above by:
CC=/path/to/c/compiler ./configure --prefix=<prefix>

If you need to modify configure.in and then regenerate the configure script,
you will need autoconf version 2.57 installed on your machine. Later versions
may not be compatible.

Building/Installing from CVS
============================

The instructions to build from CVS are similar to the instructions listed
above, with a few additional steps:

- You need to create a symbolic link called 'gnat_src' that points to recent
  GNAT sources (preferably sources as recent as the GPS sources used), e.g.
  gcc/gcc/ada from the gcc CVS HEAD sources available at gcc.gnu.org

- You need to use the CVS version of GtkAda matching GPS sources (same date/tag)
