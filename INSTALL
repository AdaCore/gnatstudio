Building/Installing from sources
================================

To build Glide from sources, you need to have GNU make available as
a prerequisite.

Then you need to install the GNAT compiler on your machine.
You need a version of GNAT as recent as the Glide sources themselves,
since GLIDE relies on very recent features of GNAT.

GNAT must be installed before compiling any of the other
packages, and the C compiler that comes with GNAT must be used to build
Gtk+, since the Gtk+ packages are dependent on the particular compiler used.

You then need to install the latest gtk+ suite (currently 1.3.12) and
the corresponding GtkAda package (2.0).
If you are under linux, proceed as follows. If you are under another platform,
do not try unless you know what you are doing.

Choose a prefix for installing Gtk+, and always use the same <prefix> in
the following commands:

Install, in that order:
  - pkgconfig 0.8
    ./configure --prefix=<prefix>
    make
    make install

  export PATH=<prefix>/bin:$PATH
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<prefix>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

  - glib 1.3.15
    ./configure --prefix=<prefix>
    make
    make install

  - atk 0.13
   ./configure --prefix=<prefix>
   make
   make install

  - pango 0.26
   ./configure --prefix=<prefix>
   make
   make install

  - gtk+ 1.3.15
   ./configure --prefix=<prefix>
   make
   make install

  - GtkAda 2.0:

  ./configure --prefix=<prefix>
  make
  make install

Since Glide groups many tools, some of them have their own repository
such as GtkAda and GVD, so you need to set up the following directories/links:

- Copy/Move the top-level directory of the GVD sources in the directory that
  contains this README file.

- Put a link called "gnat_src" in the directory that contains this README file.
  The link should point to the src/ada directory in the GNAT sources.
  This tool requires at least GNAT 3.15.

- Put a link called "gtkada" in the directory that contains this README file.
  The link should point to the top level GtkAda 2.0 source directory.

All the tools need access to an installed version of GtkAda 2.0 (GtkAda 1.2
won't work with Glide 2). Make sure that the proper gtkada-config is found in
your PATH.

The directory containing this README (usually called glidiator if taken
fresh from CVS) should look like:

aunit/
browsers/
builder
common/
gbuilder/
glide/
gnat/
gnat_src -> /home/my_account/gnat/src/ada
gtkada -> /home/my_account/gtk/GtkAda
gvd/
kernel/
metrics/
prj_editor/
src_editor/
syntax/
vcs/
vdiff/
vsearch/
widgets/

Building Glide 2
=================

After having configured and installed Gtk+/Gtkada,
you need to execute the following commands in the directory that contains this
README file:
    [glidiator] $ ./configure --prefix=<prefix_dir>
    [glidiator] $ make
    [glidiator] $ make -C docs install

For best compatibility with GNAT, <prefix_dir> should be same as the
prefix used for building GNAT.
