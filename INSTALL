Building/Installing from sources
================================

To build GPS from sources, you need to have GNU make available as
a prerequisite.

You need to use a recent version of the GNAT compiler (version >= GNAT 3.15, or
GCC >= 3.4).

You then need to install the Gtk+ 2.2.x suite (e.g 2.2.4).
To download and build Gtk+, follow the instructions given at www.gtk.org

Once Gtk+ has been installed, you need to install GtkAda 2.2.1.
See GtkAda-2.2.1/INSTALL for instructions.

Then make sure that your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables point
to the GtkAda installation

Once GtkAda has been installed, extract the GPS sources:

  $ gzip -dc gps-*-src.tgz | tar xvf -
  $ cd gps*

Then execute the following commands:

  $ ./configure --prefix=<prefix>
  $ make
  $ make install

Note: if you want to use a C compiler other than the one provided with
gnat, you can replace the configure line above by:
CC=/path/to/c/compiler ./configure --prefix=<prefix>

If you need to modify configure.in and then regenerate the configure script,
you will need autoconf version 2.54 installed on your machine. Later versions
may not be compatible.
