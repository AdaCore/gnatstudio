Building/Installing from sources
================================

To build GPS from sources, you need to have GNU make available as
a prerequisite.

Then you need to install the GNAT 3.15 or 3.16 compiler on your machine.

You then need to install the Gtk+ 2 suite (e.g 2.2.1).
To download and build Gtk+, follow the instructions given at www.gtk.org

Once Gtk+ has been installed, extract the GPS sources:

  $ gzip -dc gps-*-src.tgz | tar xvf -
  $ cd gps*

Choose a prefix to install GPS:

  $ prefix=<prefix>

Then build GtkAda:

  $ cd gtkada
  $ ./configure --prefix=$prefix
  $ make -C src install
  $ cd ..

Then make sure that your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables point
to the GtkAda installation

After having configured and installed Gtk+/Gtkada, execute the following
commands at the top level GPS source directory:

  $ ./configure --prefix=$prefix
  $ make
  $ make install

Note: if you want to use a C compiler other than the one provided with
gnat, you can replace the configure lines above by:
CC=/path/to/c/compiler ./configure --prefix=$prefix

If you need to modify configure.in and then regenerate the configure script,
you will need autoconf version 2.54 installed on your machine. Later version
may not be compatible.
