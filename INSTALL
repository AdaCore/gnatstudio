Installing from sources
=======================

To install Glide from sources, you need to have access to all the
tools described in design/dependencies.txt.

The first thing to do is to install the GNAT compiler on your machine.
You currently need a GNAT version more recent than 01/03/2002.
Note that GNAT must be installed before compiling any of the other
packages, since glib depends on a specific version of the compiler.

You then need to install the gtk+ suite itself. Currently, you need at
least a version 1.3.12.

Install, in that order:
  - pkgconfig 0.8
    ./configure --prefix=<directory>
    make
    make install

  - glib 1.3.12
    ./configure --prefix=<directory>
    make
    make install

  - atk 0.8
   ./configure --prefix=<directory>
   make
   make install

  - pango 0.23
   ./configure --prefix=<directory>
   make
   make install

You can then install the Ada code, in that order

  - GtkAda
  - glidiator + gvd
    Be careful that some links need to be setup before compiling
    glidiator.


FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
================================

1. I have installed from source all the packages of gtk+ without any
   problem. However, when compiling Glide itself, I get errors in some
   headers file in glib (typically gmessage.h)

   A: you need to compile glib with the same compiler that you are using
      to compile glide.
