Building/Installing from sources
================================

To build GPS from sources, you need to have GNU make available as
a prerequisite.

Then you need to install the GNAT compiler on your machine.
You need a version of GNAT as recent as the GPS sources themselves,
since GPS relies on very recent features of GNAT.

GNAT must be installed before compiling any of the other
packages, and the C compiler that comes with GNAT must be used to build
Gtk+, since the Gtk+ packages are dependent on the particular compiler used.

You then need to install the latest Gtk+ suite (currently 2.0.0) and
the corresponding GtkAda package (2.0).
To build Gtk+, follow the steps described in docs/gtk-build.txt.
To build GtkAda:

  ./configure --prefix=<prefix>
  make
  make install

Since GPS groups many tools, some of them have their own repository
such as GtkAda and GVD, so you need to set up the following directories/links:

- Copy/Move the top-level directory of the GVD sources in the directory that
  contains this README file.

- Put a link called "gnat_src" in the directory that contains this README file.
  The link should point to the src/ada directory in the GNAT sources.
  This tool requires at least GNAT 3.15a.

- Put a link called "gtkada" in the directory that contains this README file.
  The link should point to the top level GtkAda 2.0 source directory.

All the tools need access to an installed version of GtkAda 2.0 (GtkAda 1.2
won't work with GPS). Make sure that the proper gtkada-config is found in
your PATH.

The directory containing this README (usually called gps) should look like:

aunit/
browsers/
builder
common/
gbuilder/
glide/
gnat/
gnat_src -> /home/my_account/gnat/src/ada
gtkada -> /home/my_account/gtk/GtkAda
gvd/
kernel/
metrics/
prj_editor/
src_editor/
syntax/
vcs/
vdiff/
vsearch/
widgets/

Building GPS
============

After having configured and installed Gtk+/Gtkada,
you need to execute the following commands in the directory that contains this
README file:
     $ ./configure --prefix=<prefix_dir>
     $ make
     $ make -C docs install
