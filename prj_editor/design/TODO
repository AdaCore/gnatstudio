-- Directory_Tree widget --
---------------------------

  * [Manu] Handling a different root/base directory
    Always starting the tree at '/' means that when the selection is returned,
    the user must convert himself the absolute name to a relative one (for
    instance if he wants to put relative names in the project file)

  * [Manu] Adding extra information to directories
    It would be nice if some extra children nodes could be added to the
    directories, for instance if we want to show files in the tree.

  * [Manu] Filters
    There should be a way to add filters to the directories displayed in the
    tree. For instance, remove hidden directories (starting with '.' on Unix
    systems).
    Note that this needs to be synchronized with the creation wizard.

  * [Manu] Specifying the number of columns
    By default, the tree has a single column. It would be nice to be able to
    have several of them, in case the user wants to display some extra
    information (see "Adding extra information to directories")

---------------------
-- Creation wizard --
---------------------

  * [Manu] Source_Dir selection
    The number of currently selected directories should be displayed somewhere

  * [Manu] Ctrees should be scrolled to show the selected line

  * [Manu] Obj_Dir selection should enable directory creation
    There should be a contextual menu to create subdirectories

---------------------
-- Switches editor --
---------------------

  * [Manu] Get the strings for the combo boxes (optimization..) from gnatcmd.

  * [Manu] Advanced switches editor: should show list at bottom
    In red: unrecognized switches

  * [Manu] Parsing switches: see if we can reuse the front-end
