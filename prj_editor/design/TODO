  * [Manu] Handling a different root/base directory
    Always starting the tree at '/' means that when the selection is returned,
    the user must convert himself the absolute name to a relative one (for
    instance if he wants to put relative names in the project file)

  * [Manu] Adding extra information to directories
    It would be nice if some extra children nodes could be added to the
    directories, for instance if we want to show files in the tree.

  * [Manu] Filters
    There should be a way to add filters to the directories displayed in the
    tree. For instance, remove hidden directories (starting with '.' on Unix
    systems).
