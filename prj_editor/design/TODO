-- Directory_Tree widget --
---------------------------

  * [Manu] Handling a different root/base directory
    Always starting the tree at '/' means that when the selection is returned,
    the user must convert himself the absolute name to a relative one (for
    instance if he wants to put relative names in the project file)

  * [Manu] Adding extra information to directories
    It would be nice if some extra children nodes could be added to the
    directories, for instance if we want to show files in the tree.

  * [Manu] Filters
    There should be a way to add filters to the directories displayed in the
    tree. For instance, remove hidden directories (starting with '.' on Unix
    systems).
    Note that this needs to be synchronized with the creation wizard.

  * [Manu] Specifying the number of columns
    By default, the tree has a single column. It would be nice to be able to
    have several of them, in case the user wants to display some extra
    information (see "Adding extra information to directories")

  * Handling of links to directories: we shouldn't be able to open the same
    link multiple times (ln -s . foo).

---------------------
-- Creation wizard --
---------------------

  * [Manu] Source_Dir selection
    The number of currently selected directories should be displayed somewhere
  * [Manu] DND in Source_Dir selection
    It would be more natural to have drag-n-drop in the source dir selection.
  * [Manu] Ctrees should be scrolled to show the selected line
  * [Manu] Obj_Dir selection should enable directory creation
    There should be a contextual menu to create subdirectories
  * [Manu] Should check contents of current page before activating Next.
  * [Manu] Should make it easy to add dependency on GtkAda, ASIS,...

---------------------
-- Switches editor --
---------------------

  * [Manu] Get the strings for the combo boxes (optimization..) from gnatcmd.
  * [Manu] put user switches in red in the command lines.
  * [Manu] Parsing switches: see if we can reuse the front-end
  * [Manu] Create proper handlers for "destroy"
  * [Manu] Should we have -gnatt (ASIS tree ?)

---------------------
-- Variable editor --
---------------------

  * [Manu] Should we show the package name in which the variable is defined ?
  * [Manu] Possibility to give names to list of possible values.
    These would be the names of the types in the generated project file.
  * [Manu] Should show references to variables in color, in addition to
    putting '$' in front. Likewise, it shouldn't be possible to insert
    characters in the middle of the name, so that we know we always reference
    existing variables.
  * [Manu] Removing a variable: should check that it is not used anywhere.
  * [Manu] Should remove all manipulations of Project_Node_Id in packages other
    than Prj.API
  * [Manu] If "${foo}" is entered manually in a project file, it should be
    flaged as an error
