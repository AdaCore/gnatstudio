--  <description>
--  This package implements a typical wizard widget, that helps guide the
--  user through a series of simple operations. Some typical examples are
--  the installation interfaces that ask for a directory, then the list of
--  packages to install, ...
--
--  You can set up as many pages as you want that will be displayed one by
--  one for the user to act upon them.
--
--  This widget will handle automatically the previous and next buttons, as
--  well as the finish buttons that appears when the user is on the last page
--  and that replaces the next button then.
--
--  A table of contents can be associated with this widget, and will be
--  displayed on the left. The currently displayed page is highlighted
--  automatically. This helps the user get a global idea of the process.
--  If you do not specify a table of contents, nothing is displayed.

   --  A wizard is a special kind of container that shows one of its children
   --  at a time, and provides navigation between them through Previous, Next
   --  and Apply buttons.
   --  The wizard is implemented as a dialog. You can therefore call Run to
   --  display the dialog and let the user interact with it. The return value
   --  of Run indicates whether the user pressed Finish (Gtk_Response_Apply)
   --  or cancel (Gtk_Response_Cancel).

     is abstract;
   --  Return the widget to display when the page is active.
   --  This method can create the content of the page lazily. However, you'll
   --  need to take into account when the wizard is completed that not all
   --  pages might have been created.
   --  Wiz is the wizard in which the page is included.

   function Get_Content
     (Page : access Wizard_Page_Record'Class) return Gtk.Widget.Gtk_Widget;
   --  Return the widget that was created by Create_Content, or null if the
   --  latter was never called

   procedure Update_Page (Page : access Wizard_Page_Record);
   --  Called just before displaying this page (including the first time, just
   --  after Create_Content was called).
   --  The goal is to refresh the page based on the contents of other pages.
   --  The default is to do nothing.

   function Next_Page
     (Page : access Wizard_Page_Record;
      Wiz  : access Wizard_Record'Class) return Wizard_Page;
   --  Return the page to display when the user presses "Next" after this one.
   --  The new page must have been added to the wizard.
   --  The default behavior is to return null, which lets the wizard compute
   --  the next page by itself.
   --  Overriding this method can be used to have a non linear transition in
   --  the pages, for instance display a new set of pages if the user has
   --  pressed a toggle button in the first page.
   --        1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
   --              \-> 3bis ---/  (if the user selects an option on page 2)

   function Is_Complete
     (Page : access Wizard_Page_Record) return String;
   --  Return an error message to display for the current page.
   --  It should return the empty string "" if all fields on the page have a
   --  valid value, and should return the message to display at the top of the
   --  wizard otherwise.
   --  By default, the Finish button is activated when all pages return the
   --  empty string from this function.
   --  A user cannot move forward when a page is not complete. Therefore, you
   --  can do data validation in this function, and return a message if some
   --  data is incorrect. However, it is your responsability to change the
   --  sensitivity of the Next button once the content of the page is valid,
   --  through a call to Update_Buttons_Sensitivity. This is generally done by
   --  connecting to the "changed" signal on all fields and reset the button
   --  sensitivity from there.
   --  By default, this returns the empty string (no error).
   --  If a field is empty or is incorrect, but should be set, you should do a
   --  Grab_Focus on it.
   --  Be aware that this function might be called even before calling
   --  Create_Content if Lazy_Creation was set to True when it was added.

   procedure On_Destroy (Page : access Wizard_Page_Record);
   --  Called when the page is destroyed. This function should free internal
   --  data stored for the page (but need not take care of the GUI).
