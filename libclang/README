This directory is organized the following way:

   - gen contains the generated thin binding to the C libclang library
     this should not be checked in but not edited manually

   - libclang contains the thick binding to the C libclang library
     this is the binding that should be used by GPS

   - the Makefile can be used to regenerate the thin binding

   - example contains an exemple program
