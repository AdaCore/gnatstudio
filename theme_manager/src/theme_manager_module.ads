--  This package provides the Theme manager.
--  Such themes can be used to customize GPS according finely, by loading
--  specific sections of the customization files only if the user has requested
--  it.
--  The order of loading for GPS is the following:
--    - Load preferences (so that immediate setups like splash screen are
--      taken into account)
--    - Load theme manager module, so that all modules and customization files
--      can define their own themes.
--    - Load customization files, so that all themes are registered in GPS.
--      If the theme is active, we immediately load the relevant XML section
--    - Reload preferences, so that user specific settings override standard
--      settings coming from the preferences.
